369,"No Way this app is 4+ star. Has awful lag , often never showing active skill or artist being played on ECHO . Cannot or will not STOP active MEDIA when it decides to play offensive vulgar media, I try to stop/ change , & ECHO conts. play vulgarity . Voice response is awful either too slow or too fast. Devices connect to the wrong WiFi , & will not stay connected to new WiFi! Often says devices are DISABLED w/o reason. Now Solved! and Thanks to a 3rd party text app that actually commands ECHO!",NEGATIVE,0.9992721676826477

387,"Connection problems appear to have been resolved. This is my go to app for all things music and podcasts while driving. I pair it with Amazon Music exclusively. My only remaining issue is that while paired to Amazon Music I lose control of the volume which appears to be set by Alexa. When I ask Alexa to increase/decrease the volume, nothing happens. The set volume at times can be too loud. There is no work around or I haven't found it yet. I'm still investigating. It may be Amazon Music.",POSITIVE,0.9981839060783386
388,"I find it to be an overwhelming app, the settings are difficult to navigate. So far I'm yet to figure out how to stop Alexa announcing Bluetooth connection. I managed to stop the speaking part of the announcement after months and months of sporadically ""giving it another go"", but there is still a notification sound which I can't seem to find a setting for and if I've forgotten to turn my laptop Bluetooth off before shutting it down, then Alexa disturbs the whole house when I go to use it again.",NEGATIVE,0.9994900226593018
