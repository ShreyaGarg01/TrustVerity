334,"Wrong language in trailers. The trailers have started to have dubbed Italian even though I am not in Italy, never have been and my account country has always been Denmark and the language has always been set to English. Why it has suddenly started with the Italian I don't know. Through a Google search it seems that this has happened to other users before. Though that seems to have been a few years ago. PLEASE fix it. I can't even change the language from Italian on the trailer to the original.",NEGATIVE,0.9994557499885559

343,"The movie and series catalog is good, but the app itself has significant design flaws. It lacks picture-in-picture functionality and often fails to remember my last watched position on certain devices, necessitating a repetitive search for the episode and time. The share screen button is non-functional unless I open the app on my TV first. Discovering worthwhile series is challenging; occasionally, I only stumble upon great content when resorting to Google search. IMDb feature is great.",NEGATIVE,0.9990776777267456
