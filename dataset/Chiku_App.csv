"This app is really great! Its has many features and things you can do, while on other apps you have to pay to have them. But it has some problems. So, the first problem is that when you make a change and after that you refresh the page, it doesn't really refresh. You have to close the app and then open it again to refresh. Also when you add photos you have to select them one by one instead of select all of them at once. If you fix these problems it would definitely be one of the greatest apps gj",POSITIVE,0.9940357208251953

"Downloaded this to help set and track daily goals and link them to how they affect my mood. In first week of using the app but so far im finding it very helpful for dealing with anxiety and depression- helps me recognize what activities affect my mood the most and make correlations between them... Premium is definitly worth the price for a year aswell, developing more on finding patterns with the long term tracking of mood and activities. Really great app so far!
