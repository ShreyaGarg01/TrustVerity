Just a waste of space on my phone. I thought it was like uber but it's for calling a taxi I guess.... It's absolutely pointless... In my city you are not able to put in a credit card or debit card and must pay with cash. So basically all the app does is schedules the taxi and you pay the driver in cash only. So it does 1 thing. Schedules a taxi to your house. I'm sure the price is raised as well. You can call any cab company yourself and schedule a cab and pay with a card.
