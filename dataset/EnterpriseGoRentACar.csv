"App kept crashing, so I uninstalled and now it wont let me reinstall it. Talking to other people they are having the same problem. You are losing money!!

"If you're ready to get stuck in front of a car that doesn't open, with your children in freezing cold in a town you don't know, and a customer service that is never online go ahead and have your try. I'm not writing this for the social media guy hired by this company to copy-paste. ""We're sorry about your bad experience blah blah...."". I'm hoping the team behind this terrible app and irresponsible management will read this. And hopefully change things. I got no refund for a complete day lost.",NEGATIVE,0.9995038509368896

This app does not work for Android 8.0 system. Older app work wonderful. This application thinks I need to travel worldwide. Older application work perfectly for my use.....personal and business.,NEGATIVE,0.9994196891784668
"0/10, sehr selten funktioniert das Öffnen und schließen des Autos mit der App. Und das mit einem Galaxy S23+ darf nicht sein. Das man bei Kälte 20 Jahre draußen warten muss nur weil diese schlecht programmierte App das Auto nicht aufschließt ist einfach nur erbärmlich. Davon abgesehen ist es ein cooles Konzept. Leider ist die Umsetzung der App 0/10. Selbst im flight mode mit Bluetooth und GPS only geht es auch nicht.",NEGATIVE,0.9989726543426514

"Phone camera doesn't work on all Pixel phones for identity check. Couldn't end my rental at the end as the rental section on the app was not available. Otherwise it's a great app for booking rentals, the key in the app works very well.",POSITIVE,0.9972008466720581
"Please bring back the old app!! It will only show me rental locations in Germany. I use your rental service a lot, & loved the old app, so easy to use. New app is horrible!! I was getting ready to reserve a rental for Florida & no rental places show for FL?1?!?",NEGATIVE,0.9995036125183105
It appears this app was abandoned or never updated. I tried to use but there was no options available in my city. App gave no clear indication how to move forward. Also I tried to delete my card info and it wouldn't. Appears shady from what I can ascertain which is not much. Not user friendly at all.,NEGATIVE,0.999504804611206
"Lost my points. Didn't need this ""new"" app. Error message for app said this newer version doesn't support my phone?? Lost customers. Does that solve the problem? AVIS takes less of a deposit. Hope this newer version works for you Enterprise. See Ya!",NEGATIVE,0.9994649291038513

Terrible.,NEGATIVE,0.9994262456893921
"It's an amazing idea with very reasonable prices, the only problem is that the app is still unreliable and the key crashes on newer phones with latest versions of android/iOS, so make sure you carry an older phone as a backup to ensure you can unlock the car. For example, the app works fine for me on a Pixel 1 on Android 10 but crashes on a Pixel 7 Pro on Android 13.",NEGATIVE,0.9935524463653564
