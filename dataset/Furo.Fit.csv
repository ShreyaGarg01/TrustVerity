Walking and running is now my daily routine which happened only because of furo fit team.. There is a very good health transformation on my lifestyle after using furo fit app.. Thanks to entire furofit team who made this happen..
It's really frustrating while posting any feed and not allowing post anything causing loss of points during challenges!!
Its a really good fitness tracking app. Its auto syncing feature with most of the apps makes it a popular choice.
"It has been an incredible experience. Last year I was just another participant in this challenge, but this year worked closely with few of Furofit team members, and I have to say your team is awesome! You guys are all customer-centric and eager to help. Also not to forget, always open to new ideas and ready to make changes according to our needs. Incredible! Special mention to Anshika for being available almost 24*7 and getting things done at the earliest. Thanks so much for helping us organiz"
"Furofit is an opportunity,packed with a lot of goodies. Right from learning through Quiz,till feeling settled - Mentally and Physically. It creates an active participation,that drives us to deliver and do good to ourselves.With daily steps count,it always motivates us,it not only is a knowledge Hub but changes one‚Äôs perception,Daily posts brings benefits,joy and a total new level of Communication,With such a healthy competition between communities it is very hard to let go of Furotfit. AWESOME."
An app with full of bugs and absolutely no technical support
Very good app to track everyday fitness.AI Diet chart makes it even better to stay healthy
"Worst app, please guys uninstall immediately. They have collected entry fee of 3k from all of us for doing kurukshetra. Finally winners got discounts voucher and voucher are useless. They are enjoying our money by cheating us. Please do not participate in kurukshetra it's waste of time."
Fraudulent They conduct fake challenges.
Simply Superb Experience!!!
Need a lot of improvements to consider this app.There is no sync options from Android smartwatches and to is frustrating to see the support is not great either.

"It's difficult for me to put into words how much I love evening workouts. I needed some motivation because of my job in mainstream advertising's demanding schedule of shoots and deadlines. Never have I liked gyms and have always enjoyed working out alone. However, after a long day at work, these virtual sessions are incredibly inspiring. Thanks to furo.fit"
I'm so grateful for that furo. fit helped me include exercise into my daily routine. I learned so much from this challenge. It merely motivates me to maintain a healthy routine and diet.
"Excellent app for tracking how far I walk each day. It calculates my steps, distance, and calories burned.Overall good appüëç"
Excellent application.i manually counted my steps & compared then to the app.it is exactly the same I'm getting perfect results.really Excellent tracking
It's a fantastic fitness app. This app is extremely useful for staying fit and healthy in a work environment where most of us work from home. Loved it
good app
"Accurate Tracking and amazing challenges, definitely an app that's helping me integrate fitness in my lifestyle ‚ù§üëç"
Phone will hang most of the time
Interesting & inspiring
nice
Tracking seems accurate and easy to tap. Still trying to figure out a lot of features but the virtual runs seems like a great start specially for Tier-2 residents and the sarcastic motivation tab makes us get up and work
"Simple and precise, gives a push with the kind of notifications we choose giving a personalised experience. Makes it easy to face challenges with the community oriented notifications. Haven't tried the coaching yet but the group option does sound lucrative"
I like it for good health
"Steps not counted, try with other mobile also but still not working . Need your support to resolve this issue"
Nice app
okk
How to change/delete member from team.
Wonderful üòç.. This is the app I was looking for
It's a good app to help achieve goals
Overall a good app to help achieve goals and targets
Very bad experience
A very innovative app I find it. Takes care of almost everything and the virtual tour feature is just amazing
"You have launched feetapart app before which gives rewards, coupons smart watch ,and phones , after using certain months you never launched new items, simply lost of our data , still I have that app , same way this u have started without rewards for your favour, just try in public favour like international walking, sports , running, apps in public favour"
Can't upload videos and hanging so much even we've good internet connection
Since 30th May 2022 I am unable to login. It keeps showing up as server problem. Restart the App.
"The app is mostly trash. 1. No edit button on social posts. 2. Images can't be cropped right. This needs major fixing. 3. The scores don't refresh right. I have to close and reopen just to see points show up. I mean, it can't be any worse. Only saving grace is it brings teams together. 1* for that and 1* just for putting it on Play Store. But rubbish overall."
Useless app my 2nd login id not open üò°ü§¨ every time app nit working properly üò°ü§¨
"A very decent app that genuinely helps with weight loss and keeping me fit. Truly, A gem of a find."
don't trust because it's fake application
Keeps on restarting the app. Cannot view progress. No idea when and how point system is getting updated. App keeps on lagging. Issues occur even after latest update.
Steps are getting updated in the app syncing from google fit but the points table is not getting updated. For corporate challenge. I don't think we can have a fair winner
I found this as a user friendly app.
Bad
No data showing .....Not getting sync with starva or Garmin connect
There is no option in this app to get money
Unable to post
Worse app
Very Good
Nice
Superb and I am loving it. Events are also üëå
Grat app for activity tracking and unique events participation.
Good app to track activity
bahut achcha h

Good to track fitness
Very good app
Support team is really active in resolving any challenges that you might have in recording the data for any virtual ride series.
Its a very helpful app to improve your strength workout üí™
Looks pretty good.
App is not working proper and reset activity data automatic.
Bad
Amazing app accurate tracking
The Furo.Fit shows it was connected to strava app account but it wont sync activities.I am unable to complete challenges due to this issue. Manual activity entry also not accepting
best
Excellent way to keep track of your fitness journey üëç
Amazing app... I got medal this is really beautiful... Admin appreciate your work... thanks
Very nice fitness app! Loving it
Made my fitness journey easier! The virtual challenges give a boost to keep running!
The app goes to a blank screen immediately after opening. My app is updated to the latest version available in play store.

"The app frequently crashes and support doesn't support. They claim to provide everything on paper but sluggish interface unable to handle traffic, poor support team and frequent app crashes leave no choice for the user but escalate it openly so that others don't fall prey to their Marketing gimmicks."
My app is not loading since yesterday. Can you suggest what to do I had participated in fitness league challenge?
Look like app stopped working from last 4-5 days. Getting grey screen when opened it. Can't see any screen after home screen which visible for 2sec. Seems major bug in app
App is not loading.I am unable to sync my data with Google fit.Impacting score in an ongoing challenge
This app doesn't load after initial screen. I tried sending a mail but mail bounced saying no such mail address. So please fix the issue. I am unable to participate in the challenges and score.
"most horrible app I came across.. app doesn't work, step counting is wrong, points credited has no logic. support team is pathetic doesn't answer your question nor they are able to solve the problem."
Bosdk bosdk bosdk bosdk bosdk
Not Earn money feature
Does not update the steps.
I am very much disappointed with this app. It doesn't calculate the steps properly. There has been gap in steps counted and many days its showing blank. This is despite it is sync with Google fit. We need to address this matter.
Nice app
The app is not getting updates with Google fit app
Points do bot credit correctly. Limit is not accurate. Deapite that you make effort to keep increasing the points steadily and suddenly one day more than half your points are gone. Really stupid.
"Worst app.. I was focusing in gaining more points by doing running, walking, cycling and by doing exercise.. Till Today morning i had 2239 points... Suddendly 500 points got dropped.. Currently i have 1739 points. In the app no feature of sharing feedback.."
"One of the worse app... what ever the activity you do ..the data not going to sync and effort goes into vein .. last time I took part in yasoda hospital walking activity .. I did walked 10 km , but in next day there is no data showing in app."
Great application for runs and rides!
Just what I needed üòä
Finally found something that would help me keep track of my cycling and runs.
Nice app. Inspires me to be fit and excellently tracks my runs and walks. The events and challenges are added advantages. Loved it.
Excellent application. Try it if you want to get fitter and maintain your fitness further.
Brilliant app. Very user friendly and interactive appliction. It has made very easy to track my fitness goals. Loved it!
The app is really helpful in getting back to being fit and healthy. The UI of the app is really attractive and is engaging. Love the service!
The evants are so good I recommended 3 of my friends
it is very caring app for health. It is very extra ordinary app to maintain our health.
Really comprehensive and personalized fitness regimes are what stole my heart
Very nice all my friend try now
It's not a good app for anything anyway Because i had participated an event and i had paid for medal they said I'll get it by 27/09/2021 it was dispatched but i hadn't get any type of medal now even and it was showing delivered means it was delivered to otheres house it's so bad service Thank you

This time kill app
Nice application.
Fantastic app
"Helped me stay fit in the times of lockdown, when I didn't had the luxury of a trainer. Good recommendation!"
"Lovely app! Simple and precise. I love the aesthetics as well. I have been using it since last 7days, and it's far far better than over the top apps which endorse ads like crazy. Moreover, I was pleasantly surprised by the sarcastic motivation of the AI üòÇ. I'm really intrigued by the social tab as well."
Yup!! This app is for fitness freaks. Great User interface. Social section is the reason to keep u Motivated.
Very nice app
WFH helps me to gain weight.. and you are trying the opposite which i appreciate. Thanks for making this kind of user friendly app. It helps a lot for ppl like me !
Great app Great interface.
A great fitness tracker for health enthusiasts!
Interesting app.. Very effective in helping me shed those extra pounds I gained during lockdown.
The app is easy to use and tracks the fitness activities daily. Loved it!
"Great app to motivate people to start their fitness journey, the personalised messages makes you feel like the app is your best friend trying to push you and go harder and achieve your goals"
Amazing application..really user friendly

Guys I am taking part in Sabre trifit run challenge. My running data is not getting synced with virtual run as well as strava. Please do something about this. The ranking is ot properly visible. I mailed your support guys today morning and again I will do in the evening for the data sync. Please resolve the issue asap.
"Worst tracking app ever, it just closes on its own and all the walk/run u do it's just gets vanished, recently a club organised and these ppl charged too for event but no tracking no certificate nothing. Even if u mail them they won't update your walk."
Bad ap
Fantastic events
I installed this app but i could not able to sign in what can I do please do reply
nice
"I been using this app for 2 years and I just lost my 15,000 coins. They have changed the app name and now they are not giving any rewards. Also before they was never giving anyone rewards. Only coupons. And now they changed the whole app and there is no coins showing. You guys are cheaters Shame on you for lying to your loyal users like that."
Very good experience you can participate in many runs and achieve fitness
"they changed their name and rewards policy, now they give nothing after use till one year"
AAA
Worst App
"Scammers. Now am worried about my data, please provide us the option to delete my data."
super
Fraud
Previous points??? So no more rewards. If so my14k points for last 2yrs wasted? Feetapart changed to Furofit without any intimation. Instead of clarifying u guys are saying u hv reviewed wrong app. This is cheating on loyal users. Had been using ur app for more than 2yrs.
Nice app
I very happy about this app for my fitness track.
It was nice app and good to use
Good fitness app and virtual runs!
"The social feed for posting fitness posts is good, loved it."

"Pretty cool. Shows your run/walk distance, time, and a few other cool features. Would recommend."
Absolutely loving this app since i started using it. It has been very helpful for a person like me to keep me updated about my fitness steps. Thanks dor such an amazing experience would highly recommend it to everyone out there. Go for it guys.üòç
It's a very good app. Makes it very easy and convenient for me to keep a record of everything I do. It also helps me to achieve my daily targets. Would surely recommend you to use it.
"The app is really yuck. firstly they attracted users by a reward and coins and now nothing. So, you will reply and say that i have reviewed wrong so this will not change your truth. So, please think new lines and reply."
GREAT
Is this feetapart app
They are scammers.! I earned 12000 coins in feet apart and lost them now. They changed their app name to furo fit and now say that we reviewed the wrong app.! Shameless people ! If you aint got the guts to provide rewards in the store then you should not keep the option also.! I waited for over a year and everything went to waste. There is no rewards section in the new app only.! So many people lost coins and time but they are engaged in providing fake e certificates.this app should be banned.!
It is a nice app. I enjoyed using it. Thank you.
This is really good for fitness journeys and to get motivation to stay fit.
"Excellent tracking of runs & rides. The features are good. Still figuring everything out but easy to use. I like the challenges and am happy that I can make Virtual Runs, those are exciting :)"
"Very happy user here. Thank you. There are a variety of fitness programs and virtual runs in the app, its awesome :)"
It's really great app for fitness :) And the virtual runs are one of the best section in the app.
I absolutely enjoy using this app and helps me to keep a track of my fitness and the most loved feature is I can share and compete with the community .
it's good..certificate to be forwarded to email

Nice app for fitness
Excellent app
Best Fitness App.. Amazing
Feetapart turned into furo fit And I lost 15000 coins after using it for more than 1 year they just changed the app what a scam.And don't dare to tell me I am using wrong app scammers.
I am using feetapart application for a very long time. But till now no good reward section has come in it. Only coupon is available. I am very disappointed with this.
Nice app
Definitely one of the best apps to track our running. The virtual events conducted by them are also amazing.
New update is not up to mark.. It is not syncing data from Google fit and my previous coins aren't showing after i updated my app
Feetapart and fura.fit have same logo.. So they are same.. I made 9000 coin on feetapart but no free offers.. They suddenly change the name and scheme. Time waste
Nice app
Really it is very very good aap. all clear to see.use is very easy.i like this app.thanku.
Not syncing data with strava I always have to manually enter screenshot. Again today I tried it simply doesn't sync.
Mene isse ek new mobile buy kr liya h sirf chal chal kr
Great app for fitness.

Very nice app for running enthusiasts
This app is very good and due to work from home it helps us to build a good immune system. This virtual run is very good and productive.
"This app is very friendly,virtual run experience is good."

"Great app, keeps me motivated to run everyday"
"It's a very good app for fitness. In a work environment where most of us are working from home, this app is very useful for staying fit and healthy. It's features like awarding certificates and medals is a motivation to getup and workout."
Perfect partner to carry out regular fitness activities. Gained some leg muscles using this app. App interface is also pleasant.
"It's really great app for fitness, it helped me to build my stamina . Really great work guy."
I really enjoy participating in Virtual runs!
Let's me keep track of my daily running routine n set specific goals
Nice experience with the features and new events.
"I started with 5km runs and upon reaching the target, there was great satisfaction. When I received a medal on top of that, it was a deeply satisfying experience. This motivated me to do 10 K's. In about 4 months, I started becoming comfortable with 10K runs at any point. I kept participating in virtual runs on FA. I did not realise that slowly running was becoming a lifestyle. On Saturdays I started attempting 15 K's in Cubbon park. Was successful in completing this after the 3rd attempt."
Very Disappointingüò°üò°
Nice app
Unable to upload profile picture. Unable to sync it with strava even both the applications are login with same facebook profile
Super fun & motivating app for a fitness novice like myself!
Sir I did not get certificate for participating in run event It is 5 day Sir pls tell how I will get certificate
"This app is a very good app for fitness tricks, you can also play quizzes through this app, its medals and certificates are very good."
It shows server error while loading virtual events all the time Most of the time app will not load the events Unable to track the completion of the event
Awesome app
I am Earned 3k+ Coin but it's not showing now.
