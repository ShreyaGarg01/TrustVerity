"I started with 5km runs and upon reaching the target, there was great satisfaction. When I received a medal on top of that, it was a deeply satisfying experience. This motivated me to do 10 K's. In about 4 months, I started becoming comfortable with 10K runs at any point. I kept participating in virtual runs on FA. I did not realise that slowly running was becoming a lifestyle. On Saturdays I started attempting 15 K's in Cubbon park. Was successful in completing this after the 3rd attempt.",POSITIVE,0.9986224174499512
