"This app has given me a new perspective of myself, my relationships, and the life I live. I look forward to Journaling every night now, and the insight it brings is amazing. I signed up for the free trial and hopefully can afford to keep my subscription to it. If you have a hard time keeping a journal habit, the AI prompts and responses make it so intimate it's easy to stick to it. When typing, the black prompt button does block some text. If fixed, I'll change my rating to 5 stars! Please fix!",POSITIVE,0.9989359974861145
Not what I was looking for,NEGATIVE,0.9994568228721619
"I recently tried the Insight Journal app and unfortunately, I can only give it a one-star rating. Like countless other subscriptions, this app adds to the ever-growing list, making it financially burdensome. What disappointed me right from the start was that the app immediately prompts for payment information even before the free trial begins. This approach raises a red flag. Paying ¬£6.99 (¬£7) per month to be dictated by a database feels excessive. This new app isn't worth that level of pricing.",NEGATIVE,0.9995009899139404
Great app! I absolutely love Journaling and having a response to what I've written. It's like a spiritual counselor for self love!,POSITIVE,0.9989111423492432

Worst behaviour that it show its paid options after download .,NEGATIVE,0.9994995594024658
"I like the app for its simplicity, specifically the daily assisted journaling (this is available even if you don't pay). I haven't tried the paid features or the 14-day trial, might give it a try later on. But honestly, even if you don't pay, the journaling alone is such a big help already. Thank you for zero ads despite it being free.",POSITIVE,0.9988517761230469
"Too ambitious of a new app to charge this much on the first go. Result: A lot of bad reviews at the beginning. What you guys should have done is, start with a very minimum pricing, and include many features to access for free also. If your app is genuinely that good, people would get used to it and purchase it eventually.",NEGATIVE,0.9981219172477722
