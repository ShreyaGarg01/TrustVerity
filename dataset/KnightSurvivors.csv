I think 3 stars only coz using long range weapons like rifle means nothing since the range of mob detection is the same as close range And all weapon skill is joystick direction except for staff & catalyst Daily challenges get harder with each suppression stage won I think Edit: I just found out boss hit box is small and literally the Centre of the boss.. Character hit box is bigger than image and attack of weapons sometimes dun trigger coz range is small,NEGATIVE,0.9890897870063782
