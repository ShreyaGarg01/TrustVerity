The storys seems great but you pretty much have to spent like ¬£20+ to even finish reading any of them. I will he returning back to manta who has a subscription option which isn't extortionate like this app. Don't bother,NEGATIVE,0.9995105266571045
"This app is trash. Why? You ask. After reading, like 2 to 3 chapters of a comic you will have to pay with coins and the coins are with money. Also as soon as you download the app you have no guide to help you around which is horrible service like a 1 star hotel. I advise you readers who read on this app to not waste your money on this and go to Google and search up your comic that you want to read.",NEGATIVE,0.9995071887969971
Please can you kindly reduce the coins to 1 don't look at the fact that it is too small when you reduce the price you will gain a lot of readers and when it happens you will see that the money you make will be alot different from the 3 coins per one chapter I hope you go through my comment and think about it,POSITIVE,0.977622926235199

The app is wonderful I just wish we didn't have to buy coins all the time. Instead we could wait like 4 or 6 hours to unlock the next chapter. Because if the next chapter is really good time or not I'm using my coins. However it will get more people to read the comics.üòáüòä,POSITIVE,0.997606635093689

As many different things to read and entertain myself but it's one of those apps right forces you to either only read two of every comic or whatever or you are forced to use money to read the rest it's really why I don't like it pretty much the only reason cuz you're forced to spend money to actually read most of them and I'm just not the kind of guy would waste his money,NEGATIVE,0.9994853734970093

This game is great compared to other comic apps I have used before. It isn't so bad and it doesn't have that much in-app purchases and it's quite fast.I highly recommend lalatoon (this app) so dont bother looking at other reviews just scroll up and press the green button with I.N.S.T.A.L.L on it!,POSITIVE,0.9988586902618408

Not enough to read and not all are free to read,NEGATIVE,0.9994682669639587
Never download this app..it is gross bcz it cost so much to unlock the chapters....We are students and we can't afford such offers to read.....i think i will never recommend this....first the quality of pictures is not that good and then the cost of coins are really high like for Rs460=80 coins only...But in apps like mangatoon and webcomics you can get the chapters either by watching videos or by getting free all comics for one or three days....so i will say again never download this app,NEGATIVE,0.9995062351226807
