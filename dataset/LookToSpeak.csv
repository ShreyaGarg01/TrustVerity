Useless app it's not working wasting of time,NEGATIVE,0.9995019435882568
To be frank the app works quite well but you have to look at the extremes a lot... The iris detector should be more sensitive because there is only very small angle between the left and the right extreme of the device which we use... Not only that since the angle depends on the distance between our head and the device... The app should also specify the right distance in order for working efficiently!,POSITIVE,0.9964203834533691
"This experimental app just arrived on the scene, but it is notable for the remarkable features it introduces for speech disabled users, their family, friends, careworkers and others with whom they interact. With look-to-select and an editable phrasebook, it can assist in vital communication. If you go to the Google Experiments page, you can read about how it was inspired by a desire to help people with speech disabilities communicate and designed to make use of smaller devices.
