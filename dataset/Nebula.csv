0,It's fine!
1,Not too sure what's happened but the Android app keeps crashing instantly. Never been this bad before but wow is this annoying
2,"It's a nightmare. Just remember once you subscribe that you pay for this buggy, horrendous, piece of s***. No queueing of videos, constant crashing, almost no possibility of discovering new channels. It's just a total nightmare."
3,I would love to use this app but it's a horrible experience. I follow many of the creators who are on here and so I support them here but the app is a much worse experience than just watching on YouTube.
4,"Just started using this app. It's mostly ok and I was surprised the score is as low as it is. But I can't stand how slow it is to add something to watch later. When you press the menu item, that should just be instantaneous, but instead you have to wait until it gets saved or something for the menu to go away. Probably is just the first indication of lack of polish so we will see, but it gets very frustrating"
5,too much bias
6,"I love the content on this app and the mission statement of the company, focusing on the creative freedom of excellent creators, but the Android app has a slew of bugs and technical issues that are difficult to overlook. I understand that Nebula is a fairly new, small and niche company but the failings of the video player on this app are pretty severe and I hope they're able to find a way to fix it. The app works much better on Smart TV in my experience"
7,"nebula the service itself is phenomenal, and such good value for the money. BUT the app is borderline nonfunctional. it crashes, it's difficult to find a video you were watching to resume, it's conveluded to get to a creator page, saving a video to watch later does work but looks like it doesn't, videos restart from the beginning of you cast it to a TV halfway through. just a mess. app gets ‚≠ê nebula itself gets ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê, averaged out to 3"
8,App is slow. Not enough content and creators to justify prce.
9,Love the creators and content but the app is just plain bad. Was just using it for listening to Jetlag's podcast but whenever you use it for the podcasts with Bluetooth it will just randomly pause what you're listening to for no clear reason and you hit play it will start back where it paused other times it will just not play again and you'll have to restart the app losing your place in the podcast. Never used it for video personally. Go listen/watch on Desktop instead
10,Good Content App is not stable
11,"A very interesting alternative to YT, aimed at being a better environment for creators and at being focused on quality and intellectual content. I personally don't have complaints about the app."
12,"Why are YOU picking my ""My videos""? I can't clear them. I don't even like ""my"" picks. I don't like being led around like a cow. UNINSTALL."
13,My downloads never finish and app buffers a lot.
14,App says I don't have a subscription. I do. Can't play anything.
15,"Love the content, hate the app. Crashes half the time and podcasts don't even have speed settings."
16,The service provided by the app is good. However key functionalities don't work. Playing a video with the screen locked results in the video stopping after about 5 minutes despite this problem being listed as fixed in recent updates. The app is unresponsive when adding or removing videos from the watch later playlist. Also no ability to create your own playlists. The search function is poor and appears be case sensitive. There are many other issues but im out of characters. Use browser instead
17,"The app has seen some improvement since I last used it it. However, there's still a lot that needs to be better. I just had a big where the video plays with audio, but the video itself is not visible and the UI is a mess. When there's a video playing while browsing, the page does not scroll enough to show the bottom of the list (as the video that's playing obscures it). Also, the UI is a bit unresponsive when adding videos to Watch Later."
18,Videos pause randomly like there's no internet connection
19,"5-star content, 1-star app usability. Won't even accept Google play credit and simply says ""transaction denied"""
20,Needs some work still but definitely functional.
21,"Waste of time, better read comments before installing,"
22,"I love that the app exists but it needs so much improvement. So buggy and so many common features on other apps do not exist here. I'm appalled by the sheer amount of buffering. In 2023, I have almost never had a video buffer for more than a few seconds, let alone over and over and over throughout a video - even an hour in - for MINUTES AT A TIME. And PLEASE add queue and discover options!!"
23,Best streaming service by streamers!
24,"After years of use, I can only leave one star. Today, they decided to load nothing more then a beautiful Nebula logo, nothing else. App never reaches home screen. üò¢ Can't listen with video off, it stops after 5-10 minutes. It's been years they don't fix their long-standing issues, I am honestly debating why am I even a paying subscriber"
25,I love the news posts. TLDR and Second thoughts are quite good
26,"Great content, but androidTV app could use some updates such as adding playback speed control."
27,Horribly slow and painful to use.
28,"The creators of this service are personally running it into the ground. I thought I was finally free from the YouTube adpocalypse with this PAID service, but the very people who created Nebula in the first place to get away from ads and YouTube's influence (looking at you, LegalEagle) now bake in ads to videos they post on nebula. Since Nebula thinks I should pay for the right to watch their worthless ads, I'll be discontinimg my subscription."
29,Pretty buggy on mobile.
30,"I'm a paid subscriber! I am very happy to see my favorite content creators receiving their rightful, hard earned money!"
31,"This is strictly for the app. The content is great and well worth it, but the app needs work. Glitchy, buggy, keeps crashing, wish there was an option to pick up the last thing I was watching, wish I could sort out content more easily. It's a shame because the content, as I said, is great."
32,"The Nebula service is good (although quite left leaning), but the app is terrible. I have another app that restreams Youtube with zero ads. It is made by one person as a passion project and is much better than this load of garbage. The nebula app is the worst experiance I have had in an Android app in years."
33,"It's okay, definitely needs work. - Using controls on earbuds or smartwatch to pause/play works only intermittently. - App will occasionally log me out and then crash when trying to log back in until I restart my phone - app loses your place very easily after switching between a few apps. If you let a video play in the background, pause it, and then come back, it's often gone and you have to go into your watch history to find it. - why does watch history not include podcasts?"
34,"Video doesn't play, only audio."
35,"EDIT: I stand by what I've written. Basically there were no improvements in 2 years. Each video freezes after 5/10 of playing it, and it has to be manually restarted. The content is awesome, the app functionalities not so much. It often either crashes or does not respond to input. I think a major update is needed to reflect the high quality of the creators."
36,Love Nebula. The last update fixed my only issue (i.e. downloaded videos used to pause regularly when played in background with screen locked). Thank you for fixing it!
37,It's a decent app to watch more videos from science YouTubers. One thing that annoys me is that huge banner above the video selection.
38,"I personally feel as though this is a pretty damn good streaming application made by a community of creators instead of a faceless corporate. I have seen a lot of reviews that rag on it but in all reality I have had a pretty seamless experience myself, also nebula/curiosity stream is a wonderful place to get full length documentaries as well as content that is not available on YouTube because of service policies"
39,"Love the content, but the app often doesn't work. Video is either entirely distorted or completely black and unwatchable. Recommend just using the website."
40,"The app needs a tablet mode and a way to hide creators im not interested in like TLDR NEWS, Daily etc.. I feel a bit tricked because i thought it would only be high quality originals but its just the same daily uploads as youtube. Nebula really needs some quality control on the videos that get uploaded especially when you charge money for it."
41,"Overall it's fine. It does the job. Really frustrating trying to cast stuff. Start casting, play a video, it's fine. Click on a notification to start another video and it says ""playing on TV"" while the sound blares our of my phone over a gray screen. Takes 2 or 3 more tries to get it on the TV."
42,Want to like it. App makes me hate it.
43,Love Nebula! That said there seems to be a recent issue where I'll click on a video and a completely different one from the same creators will play. I thought this was my fault the first time but after about ten separate incidents I know I'm not clicking the wind video since I checked and the video that played wasn't even in the screen I was selecting the desired video from. Please fix this and create a better way to remove watched videos other than 1 at a time.
44,"LOVE nebula. Hate the app. Abysmal performance, crashes, videos randomly stop playing."
45,"Amazing streaming platform with even better creators, no adds and full of original shows"
46,"I really don't like picture-in-picture features on apps; when I hit the home button, I want to go back to my clean homescreen. Unfortunately, when I disable this functionality, it breaks the app every time I leave it. Really messes up my ability to multitask, and makes the app a poor replacement for YouTube for me, which was my original intention with getting Nebula."
47,"Can't use the app without subscribing? I want to see if the app is as bad as everyone says before subscribing, is there no trial or free content to try first?"
48,"It would be helpful to have an easily accessible place to see videos in progress. Creators and Videos should both be in the library tab, instead of creators being under ""see all"". But the video player is easy to use, fast, and doesn't lag. I love supporting creators directly and not getting ads."
49,"This is a good and functional app. I've had no trouble using any of the app's core features, and had no trouble casting to my TV. As for improvements, I would add a rewind/fast forward feature for podcasts, as scrubbing on such a small control bar is rather difficult."
50,"App is very barely functional, multiple hard restarts to finish watching one video"
51,"I love the content, and the concept, but the app needs a lot of work. It's slow, clunky, buggy, bizarre UX choices (""My Videos"" in library is horizontal scroll with rest of screen wasted instead of vertical scroll??) at times."
52,FORCES YOU TO SIGN UP JUST TO ENTER DO I'M NOT SIGNING UP DELETED INSTEAD.
53,"Yay good video people, although I think even a crude recommendation algorithm would make the app a lot easier to use. There's a lot of different content on here, and it can take a while to find the stuff I want to watch"
54,"1080p videos buffering every 5 seconds. Force closing app and clearing cache doesn't resolve the issue. Happens on 5g and WiFi. Guessing its a server-side issue. A shame as the content offered would be good if I could watch it. Back to YouTube I guess :(- Edit June 9th 23; hopefully, the analytics feature added to this version can pick up the blank screen and spinning blue circle I get on every video"
55,"The content on the app is five stars, but the app itself is two stars. So that's why I give it four stars. I used the app three or four years ago and the app of today is leagues ahead of where it was then. However there are several little features that the app lacks or bugs that the app has that make it harder to use. While the things I've learned from their videos have been valuable to me, the bugs and lack of some features made it hard to use in the end. I'll check back in two years."
56,The only thing I could ever ask to make this better is personal Playlist's
57,"It's locked in landscape view. This is ideal for watching videos, but it makes navigating menus and choosing a video much harder"
58,"content is great, but the app sucks."
59,Simply won't work when I try and stream anything.
60,This is the worst app i have ever seen yeah and I will say it again this is THE WORST APPLICATION IN HUMAN HISTORY
61,"Great content which I don't mind paying for. Horrible app. No playlists, bookmarks... If you want to watch a series of history episodes, it makes you scroll down through tens of episodes to get to the first episode. You almost need pen and paper to mark the things you want to watch. I will almost certainly cancel my subscripiton afeter the one I have runs out."
62,"I love the service but the app is so bad. I've been trying to listen to podcasts like the Layover, but it's impossible to get through 10 mins a podcast without a crash, let alone a full episode. It's been like this since at least March, and it's now 3 months later with no improvements in sight."
63,Randomly stops working for no reason
64,Horrible audio stuttering and intermittent noises during playback through chromecast. I have streamed many services through Chromecast with zero issues. I just tried to watch a video with this app and it is terrible. Picture is fine. But the audio issues make this app unusable...
65,App works well
66,No trial. Or anyting to see if I actually want the app before I give them information
67,how TF do I register?
68,"Love the content and the concept, but the functionality of the app is not good. A lot of it I can't really define but it just doesn't run smoothly: switching screens, casting to my Chromecast, skipping to the next video or the video or not keeping track of what part of the video I'm on when I switch between casting and my phone, long loading times. It works, but it doesn't feel good. I'll subscribe again once they've had some time to polish it"
69,"Basic functionality doesn't work. I can't search, I can't look at the contents of a channel. Even though the price is cheap it's ballsy to charge money for this"
70,THERE'S NO JET LAG THE GAME I'M UNINSTALLING THIS APP I DON'T CARE NO JET LAG THE GAME NOT WORTH IT.
71,Great contents
72,"Super super superrrr expensive. It's basically Youtube, but more expensive. If you want to support your Fav Youtubers, then by all means go ahead. For me though, nah."
73,How can I see the latest videos uploaded by creators I follow in the nebula app (not as notifications)? Update: great to hear this function is available. Increased to 4*
74,"Great idea, poor app though. I love the videos on Nebula and the idea itself is very cool. But some functions in the app just don't work. Streaming to a tv takes ages and pause and play doesn't work. If this geta fixed, this might as well be one of the best platforms for content creators. Right now, the hustle of using the app is sadly too big..."
75,Really like the whole platform
76,Spend money on improving app user experience please üôè
77,Stopped working
78,"The app is absolutely un-useable. It crashes every 5 minutes, it says it's still playing in the background even when you close the app completely and you can't swipe the notification away, and odds of it even being able to load on data or WiFi are low. Such a shame, the content is great, but the app just does not work."
79,"I kinda like Nebula but this app has been so buggy for the longest time. Even after a couple of updates (more than a few years because they update so infrequently), it's been laggy, has had frequent crashes, and been generally a poor user experience. Someone should come up with an alternative player like how YouTube has vanced or the new alternatives to YouTube vanced."
80,"Lovely videos, lovely service, but the app not running after a few seconds of the tab being out of focus or with the screen being off is a constant annoyance.. Other video apps with far fewer resources, small audiences, and quality in general seem to have no issues in implementing this. That fixing it isn't the number one, most urgent priority for a *video essay* provider is simpl6 bizarre to me. Again, I love the product, provider, content, and most everything about it, so 4/5 stars."
81,"The app is overall very good, I only have one slight issue. The media player in the notification shade will not go away. Like the app has been closed for a few days and the video still sits in the media player and it just says ""The current media session cannot be hidden"" when I try to clear it. What's that all about?"
82,Works great for me. Watch lists would be a great feature
83,"I support nebula, I like the content of nebula, I like many of the creatures on nebula, and plan to stay subscribed to nebula. But this app is BAD. It's hard to navigate, glitchy, and lacks the features of almost every other video player. A podcast player that doesn't even let you play podcasts with the screen off for more than 30 seconds without freezing. No skip forward or backward 30/10 seconds makes navigating back to where I was in a video or a part I want to rewatch impossible"
84,"Can't get the resolution changes to work for the life of me. Always crashes the app when I click on it. Any videos longer than about 20 minutes are extremely sluggish to load. Also a little confused by the lack of comments, although not really an issue. I am a fan of the UI and, of course, supporting creators. Hope things improve <3"
85,Authentication failed error on sign up. Could not even use the app.
86,nebula is one of the best services for getting high quality educational content and supporting your favorite education YouTubers on their own platform where they can deliver high quality content without being afraid of running a foul of YouTube's capricious advertising standards and the algorithm
87,missing basic functionality like the ability to pause and resume a video five minutes later
88,"The content on this App is great, the app itself however is terrible. Playback just pauses completely when buffering and simply doesn't resume. The structure of the UI makes no sense to me and thumbnails take forever to load"
89,"Decent content that you can get elsewhere, baked into an absolutely horrendous app that makes HBO now look good. It lags, crashes constantly, and does not exist on Android tv or Google tv... I have to stream this app to my 2015 Chromecast, on my 2022 smartTV... What? Why on earth would you build a modern media streaming app from the ground up that doesn't integrate with streaming platforms? Fire your project engineer and just start over. GPT4 could probably build a more useful service."
90,Lock out my account and asked me to subscribe again and to expensive
91,"App keeps crashing in mini player mode, no way to disable watch history, no option to watch below 360p"
92,"No ""try before you buy"" option."
93,Great content poor execution as others have said it is very janky. Really need the ability to curate what goes to your homepage or at least the ability to hide the videos that you have no interest in
94,"The app is very clunky, often freezes when searching for something or trying to load a video, and generally feels very unfinished. Whilst the exclusive content on nebula is certainly nice and unique from YouTube, and the general concept of nebula being a streaming service where content creators aren't bound by algorithm and monetisation constraints is a good one; in nebula's case, it isn't worth the price tag. Especially when the app is slow, clunky and feels unfinished."
95,"Awful Ui. The app doesn't show your feed of subscribed videos. Have to go 2 menus deep to get that. In 'your videos' page it lumps in videos you have already watched. And it's a side scroll menu, so only 1/4 of the screen is taken up. A bafflingly idea tbh. It's just not easy to use. There are so many streaming apps now that a good layout is almost templated. Should be alot better really."
96,I really like the content but this app is so unstable it is too annoying to warrant the subscription fee. Just constantly crashes when I'm trying to listen especially with my screen off which I am used to doing with youtube at work to pass the time. I have no real need for it outside that
97,"So much happier to be running this over YouTube. Excellent content, no advertisements, and no invasive pop-ups. Only suggestions: add a like button to help users keep track of content they enjoy :)"
98,"Unreliable app, keeps crashing, cannot play podcasts without crashing, also there's no way to skip ahead or back a few seconds on podcasts"
99,"Great platform, great videos, terrible app."
100,You need to make your podcasting experience better!
101,App is freezing on the launch splash screen. Cannot watch any content 9n the app.
102,Great content AWFUL app! I love the creators on this app. I love the subscription rates. I don't kind the simplicity of the app. I love the download feature. But this app.... Is just riddled with bugs. From constant crashes to buggy downloads and a poor browsing experience. It's why I've given this app only one star. It could have been So Much Better!
103,"Love the videos, but app functions need a lot of work. Examples. When looking a good video, i cant click the name of the maker. Would be nice if it opens the clip makers page. Especially when casting it to google chromecast, this does not work. Also the search function is extremely low tier. You need to be extremely secure what you type"
104,"This app not only freezes repeatedly, but it sucked up almost 30GB of my wireless data in three freaking days!! I don't even use that much in a week using YT!! So now, that is to the nebula app, my speeds are slowed for the whole month! I love nebula itself, but I will NEVER use this app again!!!"
105,"the ui needs some work. Searching for things give clunky results and its hard to keep track of creators whose content you frequently watch, things youve already watched or partially watched. The app also tends to keep playing when you put your phone to sleep. abillity to toggle mode would good. Finally i jusy dont feel like enough content is produced over a period for the subscription to be worth it. The exclusive content also tends to be lower production value than documentaries id pay for."
106,I like it great! But I can't give a video app wherein I can download videos 5 stars if it DOES NOT ALLOW downloads unto my SD card. They need to make this a feature.
107,"Great idea, garbage app, it's slow to load, unresponsive to input, and can't even load a short video properly"
108,"Terrible platform to stream - speed is independent of quality. Even with quality set to low, video cannot buffer well for continuous play (fix your end and I'll fix my review)"
109,"The content is good, but God, the app runs so slow."
110,App certainly has issues such as Chromecast video queues not working or looking at videos under browse will continually load older and older videos.
111,The app and the website seem to suffer bandwidth issues. Videos will hang for 3-5 minutes every 5-20 minutes. I am unable to listen to podcasts as they will stop playing after 10 or so minutes and as far as I can tell the app crashes in the background. Then need to navigate back to the podcasts to resume playing only for it to do it again.
112,In the last few weeks the app just will not launch. Single star in the middle of the screen. Rather watch ads on YT.
113,"Great content love the service but app is glitchy - struggles with switching between landscaping portrait modes which means I have to force close the app when I want to pick a new video and have them viewing a video in landscape. Other than that, good"
114,"I can't pause a video and pick up where I paused. I have to close it and reopen and navigate to where I was. I think playing videos is what most people use the app for so why can't you folks even get that core freature to work smoothly. I got an awesome deal for a year membership, $15 I think for Curiosity and Nebula. But even at that price I won't renew when the time comes unless the app is improved."
115,App won't launch (can't get past the splash screen)
116,"Content is great, but when I play video with screen turned off it stops after 5 minutes. Hope you'll fix it"
117,"Absolutely the worst media app I've ever used. Casting is low quality and still buffers every minute (other apps are fine at full quality), and while you can add videos to watch later you can't find the watch later list, and search only works sometimes for example you can pull in ""real engineering"" and submit but nothing will come up until you repeat the search."
118,This app sucks. I downloaded it onto 2 phones and the app keeps pausing/stopping podcasts at random intervals.
119,"Great Content and Price, Subpar UI/UX. Needs some more polish. Highly responsive though these days."
120,I love this service but the app won't even open anymore :(
121,"Nebula is great, but the android app is a slow and buggy mess."
122,"Works very well in my experience. I have not experienced any issues. I do miss the comments and voting from YouTube, and I suspect the community discussion on the platform would be much more valuable than that of YouTube. I'm glad to be supporting some of these great creators directly."
123,"Love the content, but absolutely hate the app. The UI itself is poor, but the reason for my negative review is that videos just stop playing every 8-9 minutes, occasionally crashing entirely and forgetting where I was in the video. I would not use this app at all if not for exclusive content, and sometimes I just wait for that to profilerate to YouTube instead."
124,"Keeps signing me out, clearing the watch history(which isn't synced). Not worth it if it's this much of a chore to start watching something and pick it back up later. Content is good, will happily return if it's fixed."
125,"Great content, terrible app. Constantly has buffering issues on good internet and devices. Keeps playing video when you turn screen off, instead of just audio like other notable apps like YouTube. Unless Nebula fixes their app I can't recommend this service. Granted I only use the mobile app, can't comment on the browser experience."
126,You get 5 stars for the content. The app still needs some work but... Eh. It's workable.
127,I can't even watch a video without paying. I'll never come back and I'll tell my friends to avoid it.
128,Unable to watch in background. The app crashes or pauses the video.
129,"I don't know if it's just my phone or what, but this app runs really janky, far more often than I would like. Most of the time it's okay but sometimes it won't play without stopping for looooooong stretches and you can't download a single video in less than an hour when it is like that. The playback controls are also awkward (progress bar is frequently hidden in landscape, 10s rewind doesn't work when you hit it multiple times)."
130,"So far no problems at all, has all the quality of life features I like, like the miniplayer while browsing, and seems to run very well. Many of the negative reviews may have different hardware, but for my Pixel 6 everything is peachy."
131,"Love the content, but the UX of the app is a little iffy. One example: When you're subscribed to a creator, the subscription button says ""following"", and when you notifications enabled for a creator, the bell icon has a line through it. So one button's design communicates it's state, and the other communicates it's behavior if clicked. This led me to accidently disable notifications for my favorite creators thinking I was actually turning them on."
132,"Casting from the app is flawed; it rushes through the titles then empties the queue (I use chromecast on a Roku TV). The browser player can't cast to Chromecast, nor can the site use Chrome's tab-based Chrome casting. When attempting to cast a Chrome browser tab on MacOS (v12.2.1),the video shows for a few seconds before disconnecting. Lowered to two stars because casting is the main way I watch videos since my bf and I moved in together. So that means I don't watch Nebula anymore."
133,"The content is great, but the experience and UI is horrible. They offer podcast, but this is the worst podcast experience anywhere on the internet (it is so hard to just get to the time stamp you want), and it doesn't even save your progression. The videos barely work either. They should implement the watch later as a playlist like youtube, it is so bad to have to close the player every time I want to change video."
134,Content is great. App is super glitchy.
135,Pretty good but the layout of library could use some work
136,"I use Samsung s6 lite original version , this app works perfectly. I'm also happy with the download for offline access option hopefully there is option to use sd instead of internal storage ."
137,"Service is great, app needs some features. I'd love to see a jog forward/jog back button replace the skip forward/back options. I need to rewind a little bit way more often than I need to jump back to the beginning."
138,The app does not seem to want to launch. It is just stuck on the start up screen. Even after clearing storage and cache. Uninstall did not work either. The app functioned ok when is was working as intended.
139,AndoidTV app is frustrating to log in with a long password from a password manager - please add a qr code option or something. Podcast sometimes cut off and require a restart.
140,"The service is absolutely wonderful and Web experience is great. However the app is just dire, videos struggle to load constantly buffering and dropping quality when I can swap over to youtube and watch in 1080p without having to pause every 30 seconds. I cannot recommend nebula enough, just not on mobile."
141,The catalogue of the shows are good but the interface is too clunky and seems outdated especially the sorting and the grouping of different programs are pretty confusing especially when compared to other streaming services that offer infotainment contents. Hope Nebula will fix it in the near future
142,"Constructive feedback: Podcasts need skip 10s forward/back controlls, Podcasts need 'continue from last time' feature. Playback time indicator, needs the slider drag to time to find a certain pint in time. These three features are so crucial to eliminate the most basic frustrations."
143,"Pretty buggy, sometimes when searching channels I have to re-search 2-3 times for them to pop up. Adding to watch later also doesn't work ever for me. The content is fantastic though! I really hope the glitches are fixed because I love the idea & creators, but the execution leaves something to be desired."
144,"Oh god, this app is so bad! Just like everyone else has said: content is good, app is awful. Crashes regularly whether I have downloaded a podcast or am just streaming it it just randomly stops, I watch the content that I signed up to Nebula for on YouTube and only go to Nebula for the exclusive podcast."
145,"Content is great. App will not let me playa podcast in the background when opening other apps like games that could, but don't use audio."
146,Solid app for the most part. A few minor glitches but nothing serious
147,"I want to support creators by watching on Nebula, but it's impossible to find anything. üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµüòµ Browsing is difficult. Finding creators you already know is difficult. Can you not just group series/channels under the creator instead of giving the original series a new and unrelated name? Thumbnails are too large. It would help us you could make them half the height. Horizontal scrolling is also really uncomfortable."
148,"Doesn't work, just a single star in the center of the screen. Uninstalled and reinstalled, still doesn't work."
149,"In general it is great, but the podcasts are a bit weird, randomly stopping while in the background. On top of this, once you start playing it again, it restarts from the beginning, so you have to find the correct time again."
150,"I used to really enjoy using this app as it had no YouTube shorts, no algorithm and purely what I wanted from the creators I listened to. But in recent months I have had the issue of it constantly playing and pausing as though I have no wifi but other apps play in HD just fine. And I use it across devices with the same issue. It makes the watching experience miserable and not worth it. Aswell during the recurring payment we were billed around $100 for the year instead of $40 for curiosity bundle"
151,"The app has always been buggy and needing improvement. However, the most recent update has left one of the primary benefits of using nebula inoperable. Presently, I am unable to play audio while the phone is locked."
152,"Can't search for anything, When watching a video and I go to click on the creators profile, it never loads. App crashes."
153,"Stable, needs some comforts I finally took the plunge - there were enough positive reviews recently to indicate that perhaps Nebula has gotten stable enough. Pretty cheap, so, why not try? I'm happy to report that after 2 months I have had no crashes, etc. It works on browser and on phone, casting (the only modes I've tried). Little things could be added - short skip FW or RW as buttons or double-tap on left or right side of display are sorely needed, along w/ ability to customize skip."
154,"I didn't find any of the content interesting, and it buffers like 2008 YouTube on my gaming PC. Not worth it."
155,educational information and videos are great
156,The streaming speed is ridiculously slow. I have never seen any videos at 1080p resolution.
157,"Love the content, but why is it so hard to find the channels and creators I follow? Even finding a show I watched halfway through is very hard. I find myself putting up with the YouTube ads because they cost me less time then to search the content I like on nebula. Please improve the user interface, in my opinion the only thing holding this awesome forum down."
158,"There is no opportunity for a one or two day trial before this app pushed not only for an email address and password but also for a monthly fee. Asking for a fee before allowing potential users even a day of fee free use to try before buying is a huge turn off (""red flag"" in woke-speak). So for me it's back to You Tube."
159,"I love Nebula! This app is constantly improving, and I don't encounter nearly as many bugs anymore. The content fueled by so much creativity and genuine passion. My only wish is that there was a way to interact with the videos and their creators. A like button maybe?"
160,"It's been a couple years since I gave it a 3‚òÜ out of pity. The app crashed constantly, you couldn't search with half the alphabet, etc. They've finally fixed all that. From what I can tell so far, it works as smooth as YouTube now."
161,doesn't work on philips tv... but works on an older sony tv
162,Hdud fjri
163,"I appreciate the concept of Nebula and embrace it as an alternative to similar apps. But I find that queuing functionality is lacking. As in, personal categorized playlist isn't an option. Otherwise, the search feature often turns up no results for content I know creators have posted about and can be found on their alternate channels after searching in alternate apps. I want Nebula to be my default but find the app to be a blunt tool."
164,"Great content and price, but Jesus the app is a buggy peice of garbage."
165,The app is simple and I love that but they should focus on fixing bugs.
166,Love the idea but YouTube ads are better than this last and actually shows me the stuff I'm interested in/following
167,It's getting better
168,top app. use it everyday
169,Videos are failing to load now. What am I paying for if I'm just gonna end up watching this stuff on YouTube instead?
170,"Awful mobile app. Constantly logs you out, downloaded content doesn't work when offline, buffers like crazy and gets stuck in the wrong aspect ratio. Content is amazing, but frequently literally impossible to watch due to login or download issues. Also doesn't pick up videos from where you left off or support playlists/queues."
171,The podcasts randomly stop and forget where you were. Barely usable.
172,unfortunately it doesn't work
173,Plz add profile plz plz
174,Death to YouTube
175,Buggy app for otherwise great platform
176,"I love Nebula, favorite creators like MKBHD, Our Changing Climate, and more are on there!"
177,"Great content, app could be better. Please give us playlist"
178,All in all actually a very user friendly and well designed app that does almost everything very well. The only BIG caveat that is just a dealbreaker for a video streaming app is my experience with loading rates and buffering. Even in a network that allows high quality streaming on other standard apps like Youtube or Netflix I get very frequent buffering of Videos in the Nebula App that strongly reduces watching experience. Maybe it is just for me but I need a fix to be able to use the app
179,"I gave the app a chance when I decided to support a creator I liked but it's not very user-friendly. I saved a class but there's not a spot in the app where I can even see where all my saved vids are. There's a ""Library"", sure, but it's not even showing there. And the language in that tab states that only vids from creators I followed will show there. Well, what if I only want to save that one video and not necessarily want to follow the creator? Why is that not an option?"
180,"Random crashes while watching vids. Try to pick up here u left, but unless you save it under ""watch later"" you gotta search for it all over again. It doesn't have a recent history section like Youtube."
181,App has huge problems loading videos. Mobile browser is way better. But the streaming service itself is nice. Jet Lag the game delivers!
182,"Great service, not great app. I try watching things and just nothing happens"
183,"Great content, and the customer service was fantastic, thank you Susan!"
184,I can't even make an account the websites (creat account) button doesn't work. Your loss.
185,"I already follow 80-90% of my YouTube feed on Nebula. The MOMENT Nebula introduces user-creatable and customizable playlists like on YT, I am switching my watching entirely to Nebula. I await that day eagerly."
186,"I've had Nebula for a few years, and I've seen it get DRASTICALLY better in that time. General UI updates that make it WAY easier to navigate, Downloads, more Channels and content, Classes, and Podcasts. I can't overstate how good Nebula has become especially against how it was only a few years ago. Absolutely worth the money and I love every bit of it. 9.5/10 much better."
187,"Videos take forever to load. I want to support the great content of creators I got to know through YouTube, and YouTube's ads are so incredibly obnoxious that I would rather watch the videos on Nebula, but there is so much buffering (several minutes sometimes), even when I have already downloaded a video, sometimes. I usually give up after one video and just get frustrated with the obnoxious ads on YouTube because the videos at least play there."
188,Very poor app at the moment... video keeps freezing even though the internet speed is excellent.
189,I love the content but the app frequently crashes
190,"Good content, but every time I lose service for a moment, the video resets and I lose my place. Please please fix this. It's almost unusable in rural areas"
191,The app works- I just would like to see it be better.
192,"I agree with the others leaving poor ratings. The content is great but the app has sucked since it's conception. There are too many bugs that I've encountered to even write down from crashes to freezing etc. Would be a 4 or 5 star rating if these bugs are ever addressed, but I have my doubts since they have been around for so long already."
193,The content is excelent. I love the whole concept of the app from creators. It has improved and corrected the errors. Now it is totally recommended
194,"Poorly Built App/Site. While the content is farily good and i like the fact it supports creators, using the app is painfully slow and cumbersome. I won't be renewing my subscription sorry."
195,"Your progress is never saveda and have trouble playing videos not downloaded. Iove the creators this app supports, but the app itself blows."
196,Can't play videos of the creator I follow. App just gives error message.
197,"The app feels very clumsy, especially when all of the users are coming to it from YouTube. The home screen is a complete waste as it focuses on ""Featured"" stuff while relegating creators you follow to a small carousel in the Library. Based on what I've experienced so far, I'd not pay for this app if it weren't bundled along with CuriosityStream."
198,"Like everyone else, I love the content creators and want to support them, but cannot recommend the app or platform. It's extremely buggy in countless ways. I often can't even login to my account. Whoever is handling the engineering at Nebula should be ashamed over the terrible product they're putting out - it's only hurting the content creators."
199,"Great creators, don't have to filter through garbage videos. And now enough content to justify using"
200,"App is quite workable for what I use it (watching videos from creators in that I follow). The picture-in-picture can suffer from visual glitches, and I have had it crash on me once. My main issues at the moment are that you cannot set by how much you fast-forward/rewind (locked at 10 seconds), and more importantly, that you can only skip back or forwards once, rather than being able to jump multiple times (like with YouTube or BBC iPlayer). Cannot hide watched videos from your creators :("
201,"It used to be that on the AndroidTV version, closed-captioning would never stay off. I would turn it off on one video, and it would be right back on again the next video. Now, I can't even turn off closed captioning at all. The display shows that it's off, but the captions are still there, and turning it off and on and off and on has absolutely no change to that status. The captions are always stuck on."
202,"Love the content on Nebula, however, the app experience could be a lot better. The videos seem to be a lot less buggy than they used to be. One thing that I would like to see is the ability to Save to Watch Later (or add to a watch later list) from the notification screen rather than having to open up the video (as an example, YouTube has this feature)."
203,Didn't read the fine print and didn't realize it was a pay only app to download and. Got to the end to sign up and it says 4.99 a mo. Or 49.99 a yr. I'm not paying so how can I get my sign in info out of the system? I dacked up and my info wouldn't show up anymore!!
204,"I would love to use this app, but it doesn't even open, it just crashes. I'm sad because I want to support creators, but I can't."
205,"I have a love hate relationship with this app. I think the idea is great and you have my support, but the implementation is extremely poor, I understand the resources are not like large tech giants, but the basic functionality is always disappointing. I always have problems and it feels like everytime I login, there is something new that breaks. I want to support Nebula, but it is not convenient to use."
206,"There's a reason why video streaming is offered only by companies with deep pockets. It requires servers around the globe for minimal latency. HD video requires these servers to be at least have gigabit connectivity, even when behind CDNs. Videos also require considerable storage space on the servers. To top it off, dedicated technical staff alone would cost hundreds of thousands per year. As they say, a woman can deliver a baby in 9 months, but 9 women cannot deliver a baby in 1 month."
207,"Editing my review down, was just in the middle of using the app when it froze and logged me out apropos of absolutely nothing. I first reported this issue years ago, it is still happening, and I am planning to cancel my subscription next time simply because this is the main device I use for Nebula and it clearly can't be relied on. Old review: Content is great but app needs work. It randomly logs me out, which is not an issue I've ever had with any other app."
208,The app is slow and user unfriendly.
209,"Just keeps saying ""please check your internet connection""."
210,"Sorry, but not going to spend time thinking about yet another password just to register on the system that i might or might not use in the future. Looking forward for this feature and will update my rating"
211,"Not the easiest application to watch videos in landscape mode with. Needs better support for larger format devices, such as tablets, etc."
212,Doesnt work. Cannot log in eventhough I've unnecessarily changed the password. UI was also bad while it lasted...
213,Terrible app. Crashes constantly and makes you sign in every time you open it. Hoping for an update soon.
214,Really janky app. The content deserves better.
215,I really like the concept but the execution is poor. App glitches and loads painfully slow. I really wished I could give a better score but for now this as high as I can get.
216,"I will excitedly change my review to 5 stars as soon as some simple features like a history section to get back to unfinished videos, and more easy access to my preferred creators. As it stands, this app is needlessly difficult to navigate. The content is awesome though, and I really enjoy a platform other than YouTube."
217,Content is very nice. App is trash
218,"The app loads every video extremely slowly. I don't know if it's a server or compression issue, but it makes it almost impossible to watch any videos at times when YouTube has no problem. Used on different phones"
219,Dumb
220,How do I connect?
221,"While the service and content are great, the app however. Is not. Bugs are plentiful, worst being the Android navbar (buttons) covering up the UI and content when switching to or from fullscreen."
222,"Won't open on Pixel 6, crashes every time."
223,"The video player is terrible. It'll show a blank screen or a still frame with audio, and it's nearly impossible to drag the indicator on the playbar to move forwards or backwards in the video. On the creators, the majority of videos recently have been from low-effort creators churning out videos for the sake of making videos. YouTube is already full of that, but YouTube is free. Nebula should incentivize high-quality content, not endless low-quality content that's already available on YouTube."
224,Frankly a little underwhelming from my pov in terms of interesting videos. Was a little disappointed that some creators didn't see fit to have subtitles on their videos (looking at you Brian McManus). Also an annoying bug when browsing latest videos it will scroll automatically to the top of screen.
225,Trouble casting on Samsung series 7. Very new to app like content/creators. Keep up the awesome videos!!!
226,"App crashes on startup! Booted it up today, shows the landing page for a split second and then crashes back to my phone's home screen. OnePlus 8T running android 11"
227,Latest update broke the app. It starts up and dies in a second or two.
228,Sub-par UI and user experience. Great content.
229,"Updating, used to give it 4 stars now it's only getting 1. The app literally won't even open. Update and fix this!"
230,"Great content, but app is a bit of a work in progress. Works fine most of the time but bugs keep creeping in (although they are fixed fairly quickly which is great)"
231,"Fantastic content and creators, but the app itself needs some improvement"
232,"As many have said, there are great content creators on this platform. It's always been a bit clunky, but the past few days videos have been either playing as photos with narration or completely unplayable."
233,"Great service and content, rating four stars because, like others have said, there are some bugs that affect the viewing experience."
234,Needs a casting button.
235,"The UI is pretty bad. Scrolling on a podcast page is a headache. One engineer spending one week on that could fix it, I'm sure. And the colors are very badly contrasted... grey text on black background? Come on now..."
236,Not a great app. But good content. Quick question did I only get 28 days for my month of subscription because I started in februari. Doesn't seem fair üòÖ?
237,"UX is not the best, but the content is top notch, I can discover new awesome things only looking around random creators"
238,Love the content but the app just started stuttering with the video moving once every 5-10 seconds on most videos.
239,Like the creators but the app is crashing on starting it up now so it's completely unusable.
240,"Been enjoying thr content and discovered new creators through it but it seems to be a laggy mess at the moment. Audio is there but the video wont play. Tried restaring phone, checking for uppdates and restarting the app. Hopefully its not like this for most users but at the moment the app is unusable for me. Edit: this only seems to happen when im using hd video but its not like my internet is a pushover."
241,"I watched Tom Scott's Money series. The ""next"" button jumps to the last video. The ""last"" button only resets to the beginning, you cannot jump to the last video. When forwarding 10s you have to wait for it to compute. You cannot do it multiple times. The video does not automatically (or at least offer an easy option to) jump to the next video. Probably the worst video player I ever used."
242,It's really slow to load up all of a sudden
243,"Content is great, the app, casting, queuing, and even search feature are all glitchy and inconsistent. The casting icon disappeared for an hour today."
244,"Despite my 100 mbps internet and perfect ability to stream all services, all I get is frozen buffering circles shortly after each video begins. I wrote them. ""Ashe"" responded, ""Buffering symptoms like this are typically indicative of an issue with our video hosting service"". She asked a battery of questions about my device, internet provider, specific videos [all!] etc. I responded and, DESPITE FOUR FOLLOW-UP EMAILS, never heard again! They took my money and disappeared. THIEVES!"
245,Nice app
246,"Horribly buggy app. Keeps pausing intermittently. The play in background feature doesn't work at all. I keep pressing play and it shows playing but completely stuck. At this point, I'm only using the app when a creator tells me there's a nebula exclusive video. I love nebula creators and their purpose but there's a lot of work to be done on the engineering side of the app."
247,"I love the content but this app is garbage. I literally can't even sign in on it, even though I can on web."
248,"I love the Site, I hate the App."
249,"I have a subscription that works when I login on the website, but when I login in the app it asks me to get a subscription. Deleting all the data and logging in again didn't work either."
250,Expensive and horrible UI
251,Unusable on tablet - forces vertical orientation
252,üá≤üáΩ
253,Pretty horrible user experience. Very buggy. Please do better.
254,"I want to like this app, I love love love the content. But the lack of features and a a few glitches make me rate this low. Please work on making the app more useful. Autoplay would be awesome!"
255,"The promise is high quality content, the reality is the same clickbait garbage you get elsewhere and you pay for the privilege"
256,Freaks out when rotating the screen. Something tells me nebula wasn't optimized for tablets
257,Legit wont even open at all but it took my money first of course
258,"Good content, bad loading times"
259,"Really good content, but app is unusable."
260,"This app sucks. You can't watch more than 1 video in a row. There are no playlists. So you have to select a new video every 6 minutes depending on which creator you're watching. You could at least make it so the next video from whichever creator you're watching starts automatically. You already have a list that says ""Up Next"" or something. It implies that vid will play next, on down the list but it's just a ruse. AND IT SUCKS."
261,Working good again.
262,Good videos
263,"Liberals only? Can you try putting some content on the site that isn't just left wing talking points. Red hat = evil, global warming every 4 videos, everyone is transgender... Every channel has a liberal skew to it. Are there any conservatively skewed channels?"
264,Cannot see what content is available before you subscribe. Subscribing is bugged so it won't work.
265,"Love the website. This app is a bit unstable, better to use a browser."
266,"Edit: The new batch of updates made the app's UI a lot friendlier and the overall experience seems to be tightly matching YT, so I hope we can get more content as well. I really wanted to make this app my new YT, but they're beyond compare - UX-wise Nebula messes up my phone's PiP, has terrible touch-recognition, constant misclicks... It's excruciating to watch content in, especially compared to apps like YT. It feels like a beta, or a later-stage alpha build."
267,Cast quality is extremely poor; there needs to be a way to cast videos in higher quality. There's no point in leaving YouTube without that.
268,"Contents are great, the UI is pretty terrible. List of creators you follow are hidden behind ""my videos"", which then separates to videos and creators. Took me a while to even find where to see the list of creators I follow. Also, there doesn't seem to be any distinction between creators and their playlists. For example, there are multiple Lindsay Ellis creators, one main channel and multiple playlists. It's a shame that the UI/UX is such a hindrance to using the app."
269,Good content but very bad ui and ux. App is very slow
270,They have really improved the app but it still has a few bugs. I still can't see my watch later playlist in the Chromebook application.
271,I get to watch 6 or even 7 seconds of video for every 15-30 seconds of silent still screen. I hope this isn't normal and when I go back to the app after leaving this review I'll realize that I spoke too soon. Keep your fingers crossed...
272,"AndroidTV: User interface could use a lot of work. For example, closed captioning constantly gets turned back on. I turn it off for one video, then watch a second video and it's immediately turned back on without me doing anything. If you've just found a new channel to follow and you watch a video from a while ago several rows down, when that video ends, you are all the way back up at the top of the list with the most recent videos, and you have to scroll all the way back down for part two."
273,"Works great for me. Captions are more accurate than YT and the popout player works great. Lack of interaction with videos and/or stats leaves one wanting. With polish and improvements over time, I daresay another certain video sharing website should be concerned about Nebula coming for their cheese!"
274,Needs a streaming app for Xbox! 1 star for visability.
275,Great app. Casting to a tv works absolutely amazing. Just really annoyed that you cannot turn off auto-play.
276,The app keeps crashing
277,"Regardless of what platform I use, android app, ios app, pc browser, and roku app, it never fails to stop playing the program I am watching multiple times. I am forced to quit and log back in to continue to watch it."
278,It's a good platform but it is not a good app with lots of bugs.
279,"The app is a little buggy, but I've never had a problem with the website. Any little hang up is worth the content. There is no better orator of history in this format."
280,"Extremely rough & buggy!!! There's no search history, no easy way to find bookmarked vids, no adding to playlists; the tappable area for the pause/play button is frustratingly tiny; double-tapping the left side of the screen skips back 10 sec but buffers for 1-3 sec & there's no way to set a longer increment (eg. 15 sec), & consecutive skips don't chain together so it buffers between each skip; sometimes it ignores the current quality setting & decides to use max quality (causing more buffering)"
281,Videos just don't load
282,"I was bullied into signing up again by Lindsay Ellis and so far the app seems better than it was last year when I tried it. But why is there an option to add videos to ""Watch Later"" but no way to actually access that list?"
283,"Sadly have to concur with many of the other reviews that the app is simply way too buggy despite enjoying the creators on Nebula. Starting up a video will always happen at 144p despite quality being set to 1080p on plenty fast connections, the video controls will be unresponsive or not show up, using PiP mode is a nightmare when returning to the app and ends up necessitating restarting the video half the time. Might join the beta just to get updates faster..."
284,If I misclick a video there is no way to go back to the video I was just watching. The app is a bit unresponsive.
285,"app works fine, sometimes glitchy or laggy and can be slow at times."
286,"I don't know about others, but my app works perfectly fine. Great platform ü•∞"
287,Deleted immediately after realising you can't even see what content is available without first signing up to a subscription. Not even a free trial offered.
288,Love this. Great app for all sorts of educational content.
289,"It's good to watch videos without ads but so many problems with this service detract from the experience. The navigation is poor and it's difficult to find stuff. When casting to a TV with Chromecast, the queue is inoperable: it just hangs at the end of the first video and I have to start another chromecast app to disconnect it and the start again. It's just so buggy. Why wasn't it tested?"
290,Bad at casting
291,Terrible app Keeps telling me I have no Internet when I clearly do Won't let me play videos. Shameful.
292,Chromecast doesn't work most of the time. I payed for the service with the intention to watch on my TV. What a shame.
293,"Unable to set a video quality, always going up to 4k and buffering on my poor mobile internet. App also crashes when i switch to different apps sometimes."
294,"Finally the latest update fixed all the major bugs that prevented the app from being usable. It's nice and smooth now. Love the content and the creators on nebula, I use it more than YouTube now. Keep up the great work and try not to break the app anymore."
295,"Nebula is a social enterprise and clearly the app needs help, i'm sure it's a lot of work on a shoestring. So if you know any app developers that can spare some love for the cause, connect them with the nebula team. Also, no free trial? That needs fixing if you enjoy growth."
296,"Content is awesome, but the app keeps saying I have no internet connection even though I do. This app is very glitchy. Probably going to cancel my subscription because of the glitches."
297,"It is a great improvement, that there is picture-in-picture now, thank you for adding it. But it still crashes sometimes while reopening the app when there was a video playing before (I always try to send you the bug-report, since I know you are really developing the app). Also it would be great to import watched-videos / subscriptions from youtube if possible."
298,Cast to another screen doesn't work for me
299,"Why should i pay to view events that are already in youtubee,,,,"
300,"The content on Nebula is amazing, however, they need to fix this ASAP. I am paying a subscription fee and yet have such little, useful, functionality. I love Isaac Arthur and wanted to watch all his episodes from number 1. Well, I have to manually scroll all the way to 2016 every time. No playlists? Why? I click to follow channels I enjoy, yet I dont know how to filter by followed channels. I just get bombarded, like on YouTube, with shows I dont want to watch."
301,"Navigation menu is back. Although I'm now getting a flickering blackscreen covering the lower 80% of the screen. It disappears while scrolling, but flickers back upon stopping scrolling."
302,Worthless... Search does not exist
303,"A hassle to use. The content seems solid but the experience if using the app is frustrating. Using a Chrome cast the mobile app would stop casting after every single video and I would have to fiddle with it every 15 minutes which is pure cancer. I want something that just plays videos seamlessly, not something that requires my constant attention every few minutes."
304,"I really like the idea of getting independent of YouTube. But there are some major functions missing. First of all: Playlists/Watch Later. Just doesn't work as it should. Also, comments would be nice."
305,"Although the service is amazing, and the content creators are spectacular, the app is absolutely awful. You can't run it while running Google maps, it randomly makes downloaded files corrupted and unplayable., And it's very difficult to recover files after they've been corrupted. It regularly forgets your position in a file which is a real problem. The support is abysmal, I've sent in three tickets, and never once heard a response from them. It feels like the developers don't care at all."
306,"I would absolutely love to use the app, but every time I try to log in, it tells me that my data is not correct. I have double, triple and quadruple checked my username and passwords, even rest them a few times, but the same message still pops up. I would really appreciate a solution"
307,Very good and supports the creators.
308,"Great substitute for YouTube with lots of quality long form content. Feature recommendation for devs: when sending me a notification for a new video suggestion. Put a ""Add to Watch Later"" button in that notification"
309,"Downloaded this thinking it was a free but ads experience, as ive seen it recommended by youtubers only to be disappointed after a make an account to see a paywall :( ` ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†ÄEdit: furthermore, they dont even let you access simple account features unless you pay so i cant even delete my account :("
310,"Nebula, the streaming platform, is an oasis. I love the creators for whom I signed up. (Some others on here sometimes come across as glibly politically self-righteous, but it beats the hell out of the constrained, algorithmically-shepherded YouTube.) Nebula is amazing. In contrast, Nebula, the app, made me want to throw my phone across the room. Uninstalled."
311,Thanks for fixing the bugs
312,"I love the videos and creators on Nebula, but like several others have noted, the app freezes and bugs out alot. Once those bugs are fixed it will be great. I also think that this app could easily compete with youtube if there was a comment section. It seems that content creators on Nebula encourage people to discuss the video on Reddit, but why can't there just be a built in comment section on Nebula?"
313,Can't even create a account let alone get on the app.
314,It looks like a great streaming service and I would have loved to try it but the only way to use is through a subscription. If there was a free option with ads (because I'm broke ü•≤) it would be great
315,"The app is broken. Menu bar does not appear and selecting a video in portrait mode has it playing in the background, but you can't see it until switching to landscape. This means you can't ""back"" into a creators page by selecting a video."
316,Refusing to load
317,"unfortunately, I am unable to test the app without paying"
318,This app doesn't work the content is exactly what am looking for but the interface is impossible i simply can't get to enjoy it it buffer and pause all the time really Terrible you guys have put a bar of gold in a dung hill...
319,App is trash but content is good. App is slowly getting better tho
320,"Frustrating to find the content I actually want to watch. Something like subscriptions would help. There is great content however, when you do find it eventually."
321,Didn't recognize that I already subbed via CS trying to reinstall to fix this. Reinstall didn't fix it.
322,"The app is slow, sometimes unresponsive and extremely unreliable, and for a paid service I really expected better. I only subscribed to watch Mustard but the app failed at recommending me other creators. I have to go out of my way to search for similar content. Needless to say I'm unsubscribing after 1 month."
323,"Lot of issues with the app. It's more like a beta release. First of all, why there's no option for full HD download? Why you can't see the channels you follow?"
324,"Still no improvement - The app is super buggy. It will just stop playing the video and never load. Sometimes it won't even open again. It's so sad because the concept and content are good, but the service is absolute garbage"
325,Great service with awful application
326,"Great content, terrible app. For a while it worked good. Either an update to my phone operating system or an update too the app has least to me not being able to view videos (only sound plays). I like the content and sitting the creators but this app needs serious improvement!"
327,"new user, so pinch of salt, Its not the most polished. Improvements that could be made: a comments section, like and dislike, and links to if a same YouTube video exists or Linking my accounts so I know what I've watched on one platform would be nice. However. I do like how the creator page has both their store and videos within the same place, and the curation on the home page is great. Have not gotten bugs like others, but I think the overall app rating is too harsh for what it is."
328,"Mostly great, but shocking speed. Have to watch everything on lowest resolution to avoid buffering, and still sometimes buffering."
329,"I love the Nebula creators, content, and purpose, but the app has many glitches, and recent updates make it impossible to use. The menu bar at the bottom has disappeared, so you can't find your favorites. If you do select a video, the audio plays without video or a player bar to control it. Also the back arrow doesn't work anymore, so you have to force the entire app to restart and navigate from the main screen for each selection. Reinstalling the app didn't help. Hopefully this gets resolved."
330,App is unintuitive and buggy. Casting to my TV didn't work. After repeated attempts I just watched on my device.
331,Just broken. Basically nothing works
332,"Content great, app buggy as in ""doesn't work"""
333,"Something has gone wrong with the app in the last month. The bar at the bottom has disappeared, so I cannot navigate to my library. When I click through links, I cannot use the back arrow to return to the home screen. Running on pixel 6"
334,"Great concept, very mid app. No option to create playlists, long input delays when pressing buttons, and atrocious connectivity issues. I'm still using the app because I've paid for a year's subscription but I'd be very hesitant to recommend it to others, at least without a massive asterisk"
335,Can't reach the subscriptions page. The bottom menu is gone and the back function stopped working.
336,"App could be better, but streaming works for me."
337,"The content creators are awesome and I want to support them, but the app is hot garbage and frequently breaks down. Right now I cannot see the video that is playing or get access to my library or downloads because that part of the app is not drawing. To top it off, I was overcharged for the most recent CuriosityStream subscription renewal. Please fix it!"
338,Lost me when I discovered that app does not do landscape mode. The best apps should be idiot proof. I'm unwilling to spend time coaxing this app to meet my need for a simple plug and play.
339,App is broken can't watch any vids only hear audio but no video. FIX
340,Great content. Terrible app. Won't load. Wont stream.
341,"App function has improved in the last few months making watching much more enjoyable. The content is mixed, I love alot of the channels but clearly this platform is favored by a certain political mindset. I love freedom of speech/expression but I don't like swimming through Ideologies looking for my preferred explainer/science content. An improved search and menu system I believe would help."
342,"This is not the astrology app, it's video streaming. Junk."
343,"Yea, the app is bad but the content is good. You have a long way to go before you can compete with youtube"
344,"Great content, issues with casting. A team member contacted me after my initial review and I was informed about the issues with Chromecast that the team is working hard to resolve. Can't wait to see what the future brings! Browsing by length of video, and some sort of recommendation system would also be great features."
345,Good content
346,The app is too laggy and disappointingly clunky
347,"*A refreshingly simple user experience.* This app delivers a clean, uncluttered and ad-free video experience. You can follow channels and bookmark videos. The content is high in quality and broad in subject matter. I couldn't ask for more."
348,Not good enough to make a subscription out of the content but seems to be the growing fad.
349,"Joined yesterday and unable to use / watch via Android app. Rather disappointing & disgusting. I would like a full refund. So much hype & promise, yet nothing delivered."
350,"The content itself is fine but things like offline viewing, search and a lot of the ux is still very unfinished or broken"
351,Love this streaming site!
352,"Do not waste your money on their service. Extremely limited amount of contents and almost 99% of contents will be released on YouTube on same days. 0.9999% contents will be released on Youtube after 3-4 days of delay. And there is 0.0001% of real ""Nebula Exclusive"". Which is totally not worth the extra you will pay. It would be much better to directly donate to your favorite creators."
353,MAKE BACKGROUND PLAY OPTIONAL. I hate that it cannot be turned off. I want to be able to not have it playing in the background when I switch apps or turn off my phone.
354,Great content but it needs a basic search feature. Also clicking on a content creators logo should take me to their channel. I can't easily see all of Joe Scott channel. That's a real and frustrating example.
355,Almost imposible to view a full video without alt least 5-10 buffering cuts.
356,"the UI is ok but the UX is horrible. You can't swipe down videos to make them small but have to click the button which is tiny and often only reacts after 2-3 clicks for example. These things make the app feel very clunky. Also it's missing so many Features like comments, likes/dislikes, hiding creators you don't like etc. The price is way too high for what it currently offers."
357,Don't know bug or not but downloads don't show in download tab until it completes. Also app is generally pretty slow example between clicking and playing a video
358,"Love the content, and have never really had issues with watching videos, but the app itself is really difficult to use."
359,Great
360,"Great app! Easy to use, has picture-in-picture, and still plays when the screens off. Love the content and educational creators; not anywhere the price of a YouTube subscription! :D"
361,App needs autoplay feature so i can listen at work and not have to keep starting another video
362,"I would add several stars if you would fix one simple problem--the app refuses to operate in landscape mode after viewing the first video. There's no option to auto-rotate or force it into landscape, I either have to hold the tablet vertically or read sideways. Unacceptable given the current maturity of the app market and the fact that tablet have been around for more than a year or two now. Tablets are a thing. Auto-rotate is a thing. Work it out!"
363,Cannot use this app anymore. It used to be that it had problems switching between portrait and landscape after playing a video. Now it starts to a blank screen. I can't watch anything anymore. I haven't been able to use this app in weeks.
364,"The content is fantastic. 5 stars The app itself is awful. 1 star. All sorts of bugs. Most notably, when I switch to a different app, sometimes I get picture-in-picture. Sometimes the app just closes or partially closes. Plus the design is lacking. I can't even see a list of the creators I am following. It's a shame that the user experience of the app takes away from the excellent content."
365,Please fix the search button. Please add a comments sections. Show good recommendations based on the channels being followed. This is seriously glitchy. You have to close the app every half an hour and restart it.
366,"Mostly great, however the app rotate back and forth irregularly. Watching a video horizontally then back out of it, the app rotate to vertical position and stay so until I turn it off and on again. I use a tablet."
367,"Cool content, terrible tablet experience. The content on the platform is highly focused, and i only subscribe for a single creator. The app behaves in the most confounding manner on tablet though. Videos come up as postage stamps, orientation will flip multiple tkmes when launching, and other times loose orientation entirely or show jumbo thumbnails larger than the whole display."
368,Using pip crashes app. Add to watch later doesn't work. No history section to find last video watched following crashes. Very poor quality app.
369,Amazing content from interesting and knowledgeable creators. I couldn't ask for more!
370,The app look sleek enough but it's unfortunately rendered completely unusable by a barely functional backend. Please fix your servers.
371,Don't waste your money and time. You can't watch anything because nothing will load and they always have trouble connecting to the servers
372,"Overall Nebula is very good but not without its issues Pros: 1. Content is great. it's like they distilled everything I like about YouTube and moved it here with extra bonus content. history, tech, science, podcasts. Your milage may vary though. 2. Like the ability to download videos so I can watch them later. Cons: 1. The app is missing many sorely needed features. A subscriptions page, like/dislike, comments, 2. some of the features present are either buggy/hard to use like watch history"
373,"I really want to like this service and I still prefer it over youtube, but the app is bad. It just lacks so many basic QoL features: - no playlists (user- or creator-made), - no way to view watch history, - no convenient way to browse similar content, - no way to sort or filter videos (by creator, un/watched, run time, upload date...) Even browsing the list of creators I follow is a pain, as the cards for each creator are so large only two fit on screen at a time. The app is unstable to boot."
374,Borderline unusable.
375,I really wanted to like this app but with the lack of features and frequent bugs I don't know if I can recommend it. Casting only works about half the time so I frequently end up having ti connecting to my phone with and HTMI. Desktop version of the site works fine.
376,"Content is good, layout and navigation is bad. Should be more intuitive"
377,"I find most of the ""content creators"" exceedingly annoying and only subscribe to 3 or 4. TV version crashes when trying to view older videos from creators I like. Thr suggested or promoted or whatever stuff on the front page is very confusing about who or what it is, and there is way too much tl;dr news. Just give me my subs up front."
378,"Videos take several minutes to load every minute or so, absolutely unbearable. Might just cancel my subscription.."
379,"Despite what you'd think after seeing the ads, 95% of this content is on YouTube"
380,"I can't even sign up for it because it says ""authentication failed a user is already registered with that email address"" Have tried 5 emails now - including ones i just made up. Same message. Every time. üòí"
381,How do I cancel subscription? Terrible UI and janky af.
382,It's improved so much with the recent updates! So happy to watch my favorite creators without all the YT bs.
383,"App is pretty bare bones on Android TV. Where's my watch history (hard to resume a video I didn't finish), why is the top half of the screen wasted with what is usually empty space when browsing videos?"
384,Good App
385,Good app with some great content. The main think l thing that's missing for me is the ability to easily see my followed channels/creators in one page or list
386,"Trying to like it, but the app keeps signing me out or annoyingly crashing"
387,I don't know what everyone is complaining about. The app seems to be working great now.
388,"Yeah, it's great. It has lots of great content for education and entertainment"
389,"Fantastic content, horrible app. if I watch in the background it will randomly crash and it can't remember where I left off so it plays the same loop over and over. they seriously need to work on this app because I can't enjoy any of these videos with how it crashes so much"
390,Pay wall don't bother.
391,Crashes repeatedly
392,Extraordinary
393,"The app is just utter garbage. It has some nice functionalities, like picttre-in-picture and downloading videos, but it crashes for me almost anytime I am using it. It seems that transitioning from picture-in-picture in to the app makes it very unstable, which makes that app unusable to me. If this state continues I know I want pay for an additional month, because this is a *paid service*."
394,DODGY AF - AVOID!! They keep trying to take money out of my account for a subscription even though I cancelled it pretty much as soon as I could and fully closed my account. Now they don't recognise my email address but of course they still recognise my bank details! Plus they are impossible to get a hold of and never reply to emails.
395,"Jankiest video player ever, anything you want to do with the audio or video will crash the app. If you're listening to a podcast and want to find something else before it ends, it stops the podcast. Nebula also crashes from picking suggested videos, or just pauses it endlessly. If you download podcasts it only plays the podcast you selected instead of making a pseudo playlist for my convenience. Not to mention not a single creator puts content that will permanently be on Nebula, it's early atm"
396,I love it! Much more lais‚Äãsez-faire than YouTube. Has potential to replace it. Just add comments and it's ready to replace YouTube!
397,Not a great app. It doesn't log what you've watched and won't start where you left off watching.
398,"Controls are absolutely awful. There had to be exactly 0 testing days. Content is great though. Plays easily, doesn't skip, doesn't drain battery or data honestly."
399,"Slow, slow, slow buggy mess"
