122,Update: This game is like Trivia Pursuit. That board game was popular for about 3 yrs but nobody wants to play a game they can't win. The same rooms are OFTEN repeated and the rewards have all been lowered. My bf doesn't even play anymore. He says he can't get above 7th place if he uses patterns and color. He's tired of using black and white all the time. It's pretty boring at this point.,NEGATIVE,0.9995038509368896

And the layouts(rooms or scenes) have become repetitive. And if they release a completely fresh layout, good luck with trying to submit the design because it will have one material to apply from, which has to be bought with your real cash.

I used to play for fun and to relax, now I'm feeling pressured to win and design for wins just so I can play. It's not that fun anymore.

All the good things are locked and are very hard to unlock unless of course you pay.

They're money hungry cash grabbing schemes are illegal. They're hostile towards their own player. Customer service is a joke! This isn't a relaxing game no matter how much they push that lie.
