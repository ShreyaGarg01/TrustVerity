Update 6/6/23-no fix for the auto start. I love my Discovery but auto start issues are souring my views on the brand and 3 years in it may be time to trade for a new brand. 3/23- The app has always been a mess. I hoped the 2022 launch of a completely new app would solve the issues. It did for a while but now seems worse than before.
