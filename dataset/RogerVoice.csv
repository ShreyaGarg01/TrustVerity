Brilliant app. I have hearing loss and clarity on the phone is an issue. This app makes phone calls possible again. Love it!,POSITIVE,0.9989112615585327
This app is brilliant. I am profoundly deaf and had to ask other people to make my telephone calls. The transcription is really quick. I was actually quite emotional the first time I used it as it made me feel normal and like a hearing person. It's given me independence. The only reason that I've given 4 stars is that several times I've been cut off in the middle of a call. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.,POSITIVE,0.9988890290260315
Very good app,POSITIVE,0.9986957907676697
"I really really want to give this app a 5 star rating. I'm deaf but don't like video relay which deaf people use to make their calls. I would really really love to be able to use this app for all my phone needs. The voice transliteration seems amazingly accurate. But it doesn't seem to work for incoming calls. Only outgoing calls work well. To the Rogersvoice team, please somehow make it possible for incoming calls to work in this app. Then Rogersvoice would be a total game changer for me!",POSITIVE,0.9986086487770081

Based on the 1 call I made during setup. WAY TOO MUCH echo & other background noise to pick up voices clearly so very little was interpreted. I'm sure part of the problem was that I was calling a landline from my cell phone in the same room. Otherwise it's a 4-5 * app!,NEGATIVE,0.99950110912323

$30 a month is ridiculous. Everything they are using us free software. $30 a month I could buy a real hard of hearing device for phone calls.

"Although I sometimes have trouble initializing the app. once it is up and running it generally works great. I did occasionally have sessions with no transcriptions but those are getting better. That being said, it is essentially the only way I can communicate with my 93 year old Dad and for that I am very grateful and why it earns 5 stars!",POSITIVE,0.9989137649536133

"Expensive. Useless for calling businesses on occasion, unless one is happy paying three hundred a year. Royal rip off. In the US, phone systems for the deaf are subsidized by the federal government. In spite of the name, Rogervoice is a French system. I use InnoCaption which I can utilize to call anyone free of charge. I can even place a 911 call if I ever need to do that. An amazing thing since there are many thousands of different 911s across the US. InnoCaption has that problem resolved.",NEGATIVE,0.9966506361961365
"Great app! My Dad is hard of hearing and it was frustrating not being able to understand what his children were saying.

I am deaf this is a heaven sand the transcription comes through very clearly on a few calls that I've tried however the people that I have called said that my voice comes through very staticy of course that may be due to my location I'll report back and read it again after I try this some more but so far I'm very happy with the app,POSITIVE,0.9989162683486938
Gave 2 stars as it was getting good until the app close on me.  Just installed this app today to test and it was working for couple minutes calling to a regular office number so I can make an appointment then the app closed on me saying thanks for using it.

I'm deaf. Why should we have to pay a monthly subscription to even use it When we need to use it to make out going calls to make appointments? I rely on this kind of app to make appointments!!! Let alone we deaf people have to pay our own regular monthly cell phone bill and Roger voice wants more money to use their app. That's expensive! So no thanks!!

"As a mute, I loved being able to make calls. The problem lies in the fact that I wasn't issued a phone number. Then, it took their customer service 2 days to respond to my initial query followed by an additional 6 days to actually address the issue. That is 8 days of not having the entire service. When they finally got back to me, the phone number did not work. It was not connected. In what way is an 8 day wait for basic customer service acceptable? The transcription was pretty good.",NEGATIVE,0.9995037317276001

"Based in France - Customer Service hours is opposite that in North America. Any requests will not be dealt with until the next day. Extremely difficult to have a dialog with them as responses will come 24hrs later. Despite paying for several subscriptions, it never showed up in my app and they have not been able to fix it - I give up!  Ideal for European use only.",NEGATIVE,0.9995036125183105
"This is an extremely useful app to allow deaf or hear-impaired people to call to any kind of phone (or receive free calls from RogerVoice users) and then speaking normally and reading the live transcription of what the other person is saying!  However, for elders it would be great to be able to DEACTIVATE in the SETUP the transcriptions for the OWN VOICE, because this only complicates and discourages using the app, without a clear advantage in most typical cases of use.",POSITIVE,0.9983640313148499

Great app but very poor customer services. They take a long time to reply to a chat and don't even fix the issue.

I wanted to send my printed text voice conversations to my email so I could store the important ones in a file folder with my other important files. Don't see that with this as app. The contact list of my contacts are located in a completely separate list specifically for using this app. It's not user friendly in that sense.

Does not work at all. When it transcribes it does it wrong and at other times it doesn't transcribe at all. I subscribed and paid ¬£7.99 and wasted the money then struggled to unsubscribe.
