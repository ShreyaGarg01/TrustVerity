369,Rumble can't buffer worth a sh|t!,NEGATIVE,0.9994645714759827
370,Billing support doesn't reply. Chromecast icon is always greyed out while properly connected to home wifi and other apps like YT/Hulu can cast just fine.,NEGATIVE,0.9987564086914062
371,"Could be better, here's how: 1 wherever o pause the video, it needs to reload again, so annoying. 2. it buffers more compared to other platforms. 3. the video quality option gets stuck and only shows 2 resolution options even though the video is 1080p. 4. The video player is just bad. There's other things i could criticize but these are my main, i use rumble everyday and i think Android users deserve better. All the luck Rumble!",NEGATIVE,0.9995006322860718
372,"the best and most unbiased social media playform. Unfortunately, I think google Play has shadow banned this app. Every time I type rumble in the search bar, it is nowhere to be seen. I arrived here via a link on google chrome.",NEGATIVE,0.995647132396698
373,"app would stop live stream at random, sometimes live won't show up, and If I lock my phone and only listen to the stream it stops after 5 minutes",NEGATIVE,0.9994799494743347

379,"Doesn't work anymore. When I open the app I get a message that says ""Rumble has stopped """,NEGATIVE,0.9995062351226807
380,We need a platform like this that will stick up for freedom of speech And the right not to be censored.,POSITIVE,0.9986599683761597
381,"Do you have to verify your email, everytime you want to comment!!??? Your app isn't good. See ya!",NEGATIVE,0.999498724937439
382,The updates have help a TON,POSITIVE,0.9986372590065002
383,"if you require low resolution, do not update. do not.",NEGATIVE,0.9994798302650452
384,App is making some great progress. Can't give 5 stars because you censor certain words in live chats still.,POSITIVE,0.9982068538665771
385,It's rigged just like the other platforms. Either be a gross divisive argumentative person or don't get views.,NEGATIVE,0.9994851350784302
386,Very good still trying to figure it out.,POSITIVE,0.9981770515441895

388,I love Rumble as an idea but it needs work had to uninstall it,NEGATIVE,0.9986065030097961
389,"Went from 4 stars to 1 in just a day. You're supposed to be a free speech platform, yet you don't allow us to post profanity in the comments?! That's pretty hypocritical. **edit** Just found out it's a Canadian app, so that makes sense. Canadians have about as much freedom as an English man speaking out against Islam. I knew it was too good to be true.",NEGATIVE,0.9995061159133911
390,ZERO stars for violations of the 1st amendment because the internet was made with taxpayers' money and is public domain. Blocking non-violent meassaged of true accounts IS WRONG.,NEGATIVE,0.9994717240333557
391,I love the ideology of free speech that the app promotes and I will continue to support it. However the infrastructure has a long way to go. I constantly deal with buffering issues while trying to listen to a variety of shows. It does seem to be getting better but is still not where it should be. I'm hopeful they will continue to improve and I would be happy to increase my rating.,POSITIVE,0.9977982044219971
392,"1. My live chat does not work at all, though I know it is working for others. 2. When I know a live show is scheduled (ie. Kyle Seraphin Show) it won't show up. I will keep restarting the app, and by the time it shows up, the show is 30+ minutes in. 3. When I am listening to something, the app randomly closes.",NEGATIVE,0.9995013475418091
393,"Needs improvement. Through Roku, my subscriptions don't show up for timely live play. When I join a live, it won't start for 10-20 minutes and just kicks me out if I'm waiting for the stream to start. And why do I have to leave and go into locals to access my paid subs? Disappointing.",NEGATIVE,0.999504566192627
394,Tried to sign up several times to no avail,NEGATIVE,0.9994908571243286
395,"Last few updates fixed allot of major user experience issues. It is still finicky, rotation is TOO messed up in this app. Remove full rotate plz! I don't want a full 180 rotate and it's so sensitive only in this app. Please add better casting support. Add double tap to scrub video and add option to change to 10 seconds scrub instead of 15.",NEGATIVE,0.9894890189170837
396,Great app. Just not understanding how to use the updated version. Please help. Thank you. You should go back to the old version. I do not know how to use this version and cannot get any money.,NEGATIVE,0.999437153339386
397,chat stopped working. all streams. even after reinstall. video and comments are fine. this is a new problem,NEGATIVE,0.9994357228279114
398,"I'll try to be fair. The chat was working now the new update CHAT doesn't work, and there is no RESOLUTION options. The APP needs a new developer immediately the window of opportunity is closing. The creaters are trying & people are willing. Also cut back on the censorship you start its no better than youtube",NEGATIVE,0.9993414282798767
