"Not so much the app as the company. If you have other options for energy, take that other option. Swepco isn't worth the trouble. If you like throwing money to a company who will shut things off without verifying the address they're meant to be at, and then offer no help when you've been wrongly shut off, these fine people are for you! I've had an active account with them for a single month and am already getting shafted due to their employees mistakes.",NEGATIVE,0.9994978904724121

"My husband and I have had them for 5 years. The electric goes out 6-7 a year & takes 8-10 hrs to come on. Swepco knows we have health issues so we leave and go to Walmart. The prices are higher than other electric companies, they don't offer sun ray's for your home, or discounts for seniors. A lot of people are moving to choose another electric company, because we don't get a choice.",NEGATIVE,0.9994877576828003

The app is garbage The app will not work unless I am connected to wifi and at that point it takes a dozen clicks to attempt to just open it. Swepco wants everyone on paperless billing with a garbage app so it's nearly impossible to make a payment from the app. These apps are allegedly to make life easier. I'm frustrated I can not change cards on file either. Really cool since. Y'all are only power company in town. Well my hopes are deregulation to knock you down a few pegs.,NEGATIVE,0.9995118379592896
