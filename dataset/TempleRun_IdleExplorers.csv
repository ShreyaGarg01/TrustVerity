"Edit: Fun time waster, I like that the VIP is a QOL feature, and the game is fine without needing to pay. The game pace gets painfully slow around expedition 16 to the point it feels pay to play, they really need to increase the amount of scrolls you can collect. The events are a fun way to make things feel a bit more fast-paced while also showing the capabilities of leveling up the runners. The gear that was supposed to unlock at 16 never unlocked either. The game needs a lot of tweaking.",POSITIVE,0.9922047257423401

Hello! I just want to say this is the best idle game EVER for my opinion... And I got a few suggestions for the devs 1st is I would like the run minigame to be more controllable like the older temple run. 2nd is add more characters it would be awesome too see more characters it would make the game more interesting And that's all I got too say.,POSITIVE,0.9986072182655334
