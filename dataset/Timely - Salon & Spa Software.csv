0,"Zero stars. Somehow, they have made it WORSE. Absolutely a joke. Whenever it's bought up with the team, you're told they are ""developing"" the Android app. They have been doing this for two years so far. Trying to help staff and work outside of my business while on maternity leave is impossible. Will be looking into other software apps during my time off.",NEGATIVE,0.9995096921920776

5,Timely has charged me twice without a full refund for the first month. I requested for my account to be deleted and a debit just came out today which is beyond fustrating. You're better off with square appointments that actually loads.,NEGATIVE,0.999508261680603
6,App automatically directs you to the website so this app is literally pointless if you use a private browser. If you don't have data or wifi it is unusable to see any bookings.,NEGATIVE,0.9995009899139404
7,"Does not support Android - completely broken app after recent major update. Multiple back-end issues. Devs going down the ""it's not a bug, it's a feature"" route. Very expensive, use another service!!",NEGATIVE,0.9995071887969971

10,"Super buggy. Jobs dont update unless i completely refresh the app. If i open a job on the schedule, close it and attempt to reopen the job i need to also refresh the app in order to view the job. On top of that theres a 20%-30% chance the app just crashes attempting to open it. All of my colleagues who use android have this problem. This needs an update to be more android user friendly",NEGATIVE,0.9995073080062866

23,"Like the service, but the app is terrible. Doesn't automatically update appointments unless I move weeks then move back. It constantly starts me off weeks late and need to scroll to the correct week and even on a newer phone is sluggish. Definatly will change this rating when it becomes more smooth and functional. But makes me want to go back to Katoomba.",NEGATIVE,0.9993318915367126

This among a few things make it not so user - friendly but would due to small changes could be much better",NEGATIVE,0.9979704022407532
31,"Terrific software for running a small business needing all the smarts of an online booking and scheduling system. In our case, a driving school. Designed with hair salons in mind but would suit a range of business situations, from trades to personal services. Been using it for 7 years with great success. Great support if you need help. Priced right for employees working part-time, so no need to skimp. Would say more...",POSITIVE,0.9988922476768494
32,"on Android when you try to open the app multiple times throughout the day, the app redirects to the play store every time. and if you try to open it in the play store the app NEVER loads. so you have to constantly close all the apps on your phone before trying to open it again. please fix this issue because it takes foreverto rebook clients on my phone. other then that, the app on the computer works great and the booking page for clients is excellent.",NEGATIVE,0.9978907704353333

Have tried using support who were helpful but couldn't solve the problem and just stopped helping.",NEGATIVE,0.9994968175888062
38,"Awful on android! For months every time I open the app, it opens the play store up. I then have to close both the play store app and timely and reopen timely for it to work. Every other app works perfectly fine on my phone so it's not my phone, it's the app. It works fine on my friends iphone but really isn't android friendly. Lazy error which needs addressing.",NEGATIVE,0.999503493309021
39,"Monthly fees are so high compared to other providers! I've migrated from timely now and since then, I've realised how much of a rip off the system is. The app itself is easy to use however very costly when you have multiple salons/staff. When I was using the system, they did not have a POS capability which was also quite annoying.",NEGATIVE,0.9994864463806152

Not suitable for android phones.",NEGATIVE,0.9995013475418091
44,"After the update it is not usable on my samsung phone. Crashes after 30 seconds. When i try to scroll down it jumps back to the top constantly. Takes a long time to load , half the time it just wont load. I had to buy a laptop to be able to continue using it as i paid upfront for 1 year highest membership. Works well on laptop . I do love all the functions. Just dissapointing that it no longer works for samsung phones, as i would like to be able to manage bookings when im not home too.",NEGATIVE,0.9994943141937256

70,"Just really slow and frustrating. I avoid checking my schedule until I can get to a computer because it is such a hassle to wait for the app to open, let alone change my hours or reschedule a client.

74,"The tattoo studio I work for just changed to this software and the android app is horrible. Most of my colleagues use iPhone and the app looks completely different on there! There is so many things this app is lacking; a calendar widget to see all of your bookings for starters.

78,I don't understand why the app is slightly different on iPhone's than it is on Android. On iPhone's you are able to view all hairdressers at once on the calender where as on Android you can only view one at a time which is annoying to me cause I have an Android phone and am envious of my work mates with iPhone's. Please could you make the next update the same as ii phone update,NEGATIVE,0.985808789730072
79,Was a decent system to use but very slow. A new update has just been done and now it's terrible. You can no longer shrink the page to see the week of booking so have to keep a scrolling the page which makes it awkward. We pay ¬£15 a month per person and we have 5 people using it .
