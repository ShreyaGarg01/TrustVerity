"Give this a 4 1/2 stars. There was a lot of talking between characters, storyline was very creative. The morphing & triangles were tricky but I'm glad I could go back and find them. Only irritating item to me was had to return to the ""wanderlust"" title page a couple of times before playing and a lot when playing the extra games. Love that the guide is included.",POSITIVE,0.9988983869552612
"This is very different from the other friendly fox games and I'm really not keen on it, too much screen tapping and puzzles that don't make sense.",NEGATIVE,0.9994943141937256
Wow! This is a great game. Great adventure and wicked sense of humor. Great play!,POSITIVE,0.9989193677902222
"great game! worth the money. great story, long game play , great characters, awesome puzzles.",POSITIVE,0.9989311099052429
"I usually enjoy this developers games, however this one I found to be frustrating and awkward. Many times, the objects that need to be used make zero sense. A lot of times you have to click something several times for it to work, or you click the hint button and it tells you to do the exact same thing you tried several time to do. It's just frustrating.",NEGATIVE,0.9995099306106567

"While I don't mind the different format, I found a lot of the gameplay to be cumbersome and, honestly, not that fun. The puzzles were fine, but trying to figure out what items were playable and what went together was confusing. I'm not new to point and clicks, and i really like most FF games, but this one was unintuitive enough to lose my interest. I do like changing up the faces and format.",NEGATIVE,0.9994602799415588
Absolutely mental and pretty funny too.,POSITIVE,0.9982104301452637
"Top tier game! Even had me giggling at some stages. Graphics were brilliant. Storyline was great and engaging. Characters were on point and very well thought out. A little on the hard side, thank god for easy mode, it may have become a little frustrating. Definitely worth the money, well done üëè",POSITIVE,0.998927652835846
Good value for the money as the game is very long. It was different than most games of this genre. I found it too challenging at times but that's just me.,POSITIVE,0.998862624168396

"I loved this game so much. The retro part. Mini games that I haven't played 19,000 times in other games. Splendid job the creators did. Just not like all the other games.",POSITIVE,0.9988603591918945

The print is way too small,NEGATIVE,0.9994775652885437
Not quite so keen on this one. Much harder than normal. Had to use the guide a lot and would never have built the trampoline without it. I really prefer your normal format of games. But I am sure other's will relish the challenge of a slightly different approach.,NEGATIVE,0.9990381002426147
"I used to love Friendly Fox Games, but I'm super disappointed they're going with Mad Head now. It seems like the quality has gone way down. üò≠ Just looking at the difference between this game and the previous one is huge. Sad to say goodbye to these games. ‚òπ",NEGATIVE,0.9994569420814514
