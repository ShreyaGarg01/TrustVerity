8,Idk how apps like this aren't illegal. The app is a scam. It looks like messages aren't actually being sent to people. From what I can tell the majority of the people I send messages to aren't active accounts so they couldn't respond. Huge waste of money.

Thought there was a law recenty where we're supposed to be able to cancel an app as easily as we signed up. No explenation on premium benefits if a non premium person can communicate with you. No way of knowing if someone has a paid membership. This site sucked about 20 years ago when I beta tested it and it still sucks.",NEGATIVE,0.9995073080062866

You have to keep paying for a dating site you'll never use again? How stupid is that? Out of touch is the best way I could describe. I and MANY OTHERS will not be subscribing because they are obviously scamming people by forcing them into long contracts for a DATING SERVICE lol!",NEGATIVE,0.999497652053833
21,I disliked the entire app as it was not user friendly and just had a bad feel to it. I then deleted my subscription and got a confirmation that my account was deleted and everything was done. Months go by and I get a letter from a debt collection agency about not paying my eharmony bill. They had been trying to charge me for a subscription that was deleted and I ended up having to pay again for an account that I used for less than a week.

No verification process. You should make it mandatory to include a photo and verify it. I have dozens of matches of 'quotes' but I'm not looking to date a quote! I want to see verified visual as physical appearance is important (not Hollywood model but takes care of themselves, and a real person vs scam). Bad app",NEGATIVE,0.9995083808898926

24,Chat feature is too restrictive. Was naming cities & it wouldn't let me send. Huge amounts of fake profiles with so many that only have 1 phony picture & poor grammar. No daily matches unless you ask customer service. Limited number of searchable matches per day before they start repeating & only show a few new ones the next day. Live near a major city & 80% of matches are on opposite coast. 6 month minimum subscription & too expensive to be so mediocre. Four months in & it's been trash. DNR!,NEGATIVE,0.9995005130767822

33,DO NOT GET. They will charge you after you unsubscribe and have an auto pay feature that will still charge you without a heads up that it will be doing so.

They clearly know they have an inferior product, because they lock you into a 6 month contract to be able to function at all in the app. Don't bother, learn from my mistakes.

37,"Terrible. The matches were horrific(like cartoon villain bad), many with no photos, many without subscription, so they couldn't chat even if I wanted to, many that hadn't been online for weeks. I asked for a refund in less than 24 hours of subscription, and they gave me the song and dance about the £65 personalized report; which was the multiple choice questionnaire that everyone fills out and it generates an algorithm. And it matched me with Humpty Dumpty. Not worth £65. That's for sure.",NEGATIVE,0.9995057582855225

39,Super expensive for premium benefits that aren't even worth it. I thought I canceled but for some reason they never stopped expecting monthly payment. In the end they threatened to report me to debt collectors if I didn't pay $240 up front. I paid the money but I'm still pissed. I also think it's ridiculous that you are paying to see people's faces and to send messages. That's it.

Just drains your bank account. If someone messages oyu and you message back, most likely they won't respond, all the men I've seen and met were fake and the women were just bots that advertised to me.

First of, most of the compatibility questions they ask are absurd and/or ambiguous. Next, it doesn't seem to have a large active user base. Also, and I know what I'm about to say might come off as shallow, but this app by far has the most least physically attractive people on it.
